The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.  Their estatewas large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre oftheir property, where, for many generations, they had lived in sorespectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of theirsurrounding acquaintance.  The late owner of this estate was a singleman, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of hislife, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.  But herdeath, which happened ten years before his own, produced a greatalteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and receivedinto his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legalinheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended tobequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece, and theirchildren, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent.  Hisattachment to them all increased.  The constant attention of Mr. andMrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely frominterest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solidcomfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of thechildren added a relish to his existence.By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his presentlady, three daughters.  The son, a steady respectable young man, wasamply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.  By his ownmarriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to hiswealth.  To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was notso really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independentof what might arise to them from their father's inheriting thatproperty, could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and theirfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for theremaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to herchild, and he had only a life-interest in it.The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every otherwill, gave as much disappointment as pleasure.  He was neither sounjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;--buthe left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of thebequest.  Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wifeand daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son, and hisson's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, asto leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dearto him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, orby any sale of its valuable woods.  The whole was tied up for thebenefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father andmother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, bysuch attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or threeyears old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having hisown way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweighall the value of all the attention which, for years, he had receivedfrom his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to be unkind, however,and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them athousand pounds a-piece.Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper wascheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years,and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produceof an estate already large, and capable of almost immediateimprovement.  But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, washis only one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer; and tenthousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained forhis widow and daughters.His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illnesscould command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of thefamily; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature atsuch a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to makethem comfortable.  His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there mightprudently be in his power to do for them.He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold heartedand rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, wellrespected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge ofhis ordinary duties.  Had he married a more amiable woman, he mighthave been made still more respectable than he was:--he might even havebeen made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, andvery fond of his wife.  But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricatureof himself;--more narrow-minded and selfish.When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself toincrease the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousandpounds a-piece.  He then really thought himself equal to it.  Theprospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed hisheart, and made him feel capable of generosity.-- "Yes, he would givethem three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It wouldbe enough to make them completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! hecould spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience."-- Hethought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he didnot repent.No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,arrived with her child and their attendants.  No one could dispute herright to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of hisfather's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much thegreater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only commonfeelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--but in HER mind there wasa sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence ofthe kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source ofimmovable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite withany of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till thepresent, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort ofother people she could act when occasion required it.So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and soearnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on thearrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, hadnot the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on thepropriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three childrendetermined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breachwith their brother.Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possesseda strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualifiedher, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, andenabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have ledto imprudence.  She had an excellent heart;--her disposition wasaffectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to governthem: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and whichone of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's.She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, herjoys, could have no moderation.  She was generous, amiable,interesting: she was everything but prudent.  The resemblance betweenher and her mother was strikingly great.Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; butby Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished.  They encouraged eachother now in the violence of their affliction.  The agony of griefwhich overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was soughtfor, was created again and again.  They gave themselves up wholly totheir sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection thatcould afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation infuture.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she couldstruggle, she could exert herself.  She could consult with her brother,could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her withproper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similarexertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; butas she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance, withouthaving much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equalher sisters at a more advanced period of life.Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and hermother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and byher husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybodybeyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really pressed them,with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as noplan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till shecould accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, hisinvitation was accepted.A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of formerdelight, was exactly what suited her mind.  In seasons of cheerfulness,no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greaterdegree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happinessitself.  But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intendedto do for his sisters.  To take three thousand pounds from the fortuneof their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the mostdreadful degree.  She begged him to think again on the subject.  Howcould he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too,of so large a sum?  And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as norelationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount.  Itwas very well known that no affection was ever supposed to existbetween the children of any man by different marriages; and why was heto ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all hismoney to his half sisters?"It was my father's last request to me," replied her husband, "that Ishould assist his widow and daughters.""He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but hewas light-headed at the time.  Had he been in his right senses, hecould not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away halfyour fortune from your own child.""He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he onlyrequested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make theirsituation more comfortable than it was in his power to do.  Perhaps itwould have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.  He couldhardly suppose I should neglect them.  But as he required the promise,I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.  Somethingmust be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a newhome.""Well, then, LET something be done for them; but THAT something neednot be three thousand pounds.  Consider," she added, "that when themoney is once parted with, it never can return.  Your sisters willmarry, and it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could be restoredto our poor little boy--""Why, to be sure," said her husband, very gravely, "that would makegreat difference.  The time may come when Harry will regret that solarge a sum was parted with.  If he should have a numerous family, forinstance, it would be a very convenient addition.""To be sure it would.""Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum werediminished one half.--Five hundred pounds would be a prodigiousincrease to their fortunes!""Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth would do half somuch for his sisters, even if REALLY his sisters!  And as it is--onlyhalf blood!--But you have such a generous spirit!""I would not wish to do any thing mean," he replied.  "One had rather,on such occasions, do too much than too little.  No one, at least, canthink I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardlyexpect more.""There is no knowing what THEY may expect," said the lady, "but we arenot to think of their expectations: the question is, what you canafford to do.""Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five hundred poundsa-piece.  As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each haveabout three thousand pounds on their mother's death--a very comfortablefortune for any young woman.""To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want noaddition at all.  They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongstthem.  If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they donot, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of tenthousand pounds.""That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon thewhole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their motherwhile she lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind Imean.--My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable."His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to thisplan."To be sure," said she, "it is better than parting with fifteen hundredpounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen yearswe shall be completely taken in.""Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half thatpurchase.""Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever whenthere is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy,and hardly forty.  An annuity is a very serious business; it comes overand over every year, and there is no getting rid of it.  You are notaware of what you are doing.  I have known a great deal of the troubleof annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three toold superannuated servants by my father's will, and it is amazing howdisagreeable she found it.  Twice every year these annuities were to bepaid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and thenone of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to beno such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.  Her income was not herown, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the moreunkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have beenentirely at my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever.  Ithas given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I wouldnot pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.""It is certainly an unpleasant thing," replied Mr. Dashwood, "to havethose kind of yearly drains on one's income.  One's fortune, as yourmother justly says, is NOT one's own.  To be tied down to the regularpayment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: ittakes away one's independence.""Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.  They thinkthemselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raisesno gratitude at all.  If I were you, whatever I did should be done atmy own discretion entirely.  I would not bind myself to allow them anything yearly.  It may be very inconvenient some years to spare ahundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.""I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there shouldbe no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally willbe of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because theywould only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a largerincome, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of theyear.  It will certainly be much the best way.  A present of fiftypounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed formoney, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father.""To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced withinmyself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money atall.  The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as mightbe reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for acomfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever theyare in season.  I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.  Do but consider,my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-lawand her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, whichbrings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they willpay their mother for their board out of it.  Altogether, they will havefive hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women wantfor more than that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping willbe nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardlyany servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses ofany kind!  Only conceive how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred ayear! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and asto your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it.  They willbe much more able to give YOU something.""Upon my word," said Mr. Dashwood, "I believe you are perfectly right.My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me thanwhat you say.  I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfilmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as youhave described.  When my mother removes into another house my servicesshall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some littlepresent of furniture too may be acceptable then.""Certainly," returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  "But, however, ONE thingmust be considered.  When your father and mother moved to Norland,though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, andlinen was saved, and is now left to your mother.  Her house willtherefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.""That is a material consideration undoubtedly.  A valuable legacyindeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasantaddition to our own stock here.""Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as whatbelongs to this house.  A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, forany place THEY can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this: that you owe noparticular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we verywell know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in theworld to THEM."This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his intentions whatever ofdecision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would beabsolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for thewidow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts ashis own wife pointed out.Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from anydisinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceasedto raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for whenher spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some otherexertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholyremembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in herinquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; forto remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.  But she couldhear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort andease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadierjudgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, whichher mother would have approved.Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise onthe part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his lastearthly reflections.  She doubted the sincerity of this assurance nomore than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for herdaughters' sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she waspersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her inaffluence.  For their brother's sake, too, for the sake of his ownheart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to hismerit before, in believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentivebehaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfarewas dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on theliberality of his intentions.The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt forher daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledgeof her character, which half a year's residence in her family afforded;and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternalaffection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found itimpossible to have lived together so long, had not a particularcircumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according tothe opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland.This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl andthe brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing youngman, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister'sestablishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part ofhis time there.Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives ofinterest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had diedvery rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on thewill of his mother.  But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by eitherconsideration.  It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortuneshould keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance ofdisposition; and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged byevery one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by anypeculiar graces of person or address.  He was not handsome, and hismanners required intimacy to make them pleasing.  He was too diffidentto do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.His understanding was good, and his education had given it solidimprovement.  But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition toanswer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see himdistinguished--as--they hardly knew what.  They wanted him to make afine figure in the world in some manner or other.  His mother wished tointerest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or tosee him connected with some of the great men of the day.  Mrs. JohnDashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of thesesuperior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted herambition to see him driving a barouche.  But Edward had no turn forgreat men or barouches.  All his wishes centered in domestic comfortand the quiet of private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brotherwho was more promising.Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engagedmuch of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she was, at that time, in suchaffliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects.  She sawonly that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.  Hedid not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation.She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by areflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the differencebetween him and his sister.  It was a contrast which recommended himmost forcibly to her mother."It is enough," said she; "to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough.It implies everything amiable.  I love him already.""I think you will like him," said Elinor, "when you know more of him.""Like him!" replied her mother with a smile.  "I feel no sentiment ofapprobation inferior to love.""You may esteem him.""I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love."Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.  Her mannerswere attaching, and soon banished his reserve.  She speedilycomprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinorperhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of hisworth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against allher established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be, was nolonger uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temperaffectionate.No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour toElinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, andlooked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching."In a few months, my dear Marianne." said she, "Elinor will, in allprobability be settled for life.  We shall miss her; but SHE will behappy.""Oh! Mama, how shall we do without her?""My love, it will be scarcely a separation.  We shall live within a fewmiles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives.  You willgain a brother, a real, affectionate brother.  I have the highestopinion in the world of Edward's heart.  But you look grave, Marianne;do you disapprove your sister's choice?""Perhaps," said Marianne, "I may consider it with some surprise.Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly.  But yet--he is notthe kind of young man--there is something wanting--his figure is notstriking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the manwho could seriously attach my sister.  His eyes want all that spirit,that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence.  And besidesall this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no real taste.  Music seemsscarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's drawings verymuch, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand theirworth.  It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her whileshe draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires asa lover, not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters must beunited.  I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in everypoint coincide with my own.  He must enter into all my feelings; thesame books, the same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, howspiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!I felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it with so muchcomposure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.  I could hardly keep myseat.  To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almostdriven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, suchdreadful indifference!""He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose.I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give him Cowper.""Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--but we must allowfor difference of taste.  Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore shemay overlook it, and be happy with him.  But it would have broke MYheart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that Ishall never see a man whom I can really love.  I require so much!  Hemust have all Edward's virtues, and his person and manners mustornament his goodness with every possible charm.""Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.  It is yet too early inlife to despair of such a happiness.  Why should you be less fortunatethan your mother?  In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may yourdestiny be different from hers!""What a pity it is, Elinor," said Marianne, "that Edward should have notaste for drawing.""No taste for drawing!" replied Elinor, "why should you think so? Hedoes not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing theperformances of other people, and I assure you he is by no meansdeficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities ofimproving it.  Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think hewould have drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment in suchmatters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on anypicture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, whichin general direct him perfectly right."Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; butthe kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by thedrawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, thoughsmiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for thatblind partiality to Edward which produced it."I hope, Marianne," continued Elinor, "you do not consider him asdeficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were youropinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him."Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She would not wound the feelings ofher sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe wasimpossible.  At length she replied:"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thingequal to your sense of his merits.  I have not had so manyopportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, hisinclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion inthe world of his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that isworthy and amiable.""I am sure," replied Elinor, with a smile, "that his dearest friendscould not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that.  I do notperceive how you could express yourself more warmly."Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased."Of his sense and his goodness," continued Elinor, "no one can, Ithink, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him inunreserved conversation.  The excellence of his understanding and hisprinciples can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keepshim silent.  You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have frompeculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and Ihave been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have beenwholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother.  Ihave seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heardhis opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, Iventure to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of booksexceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just andcorrect, and his taste delicate and pure.  His abilities in everyrespect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his personcan hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, whichare uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, isperceived.  At present, I know him so well, that I think him reallyhandsome; or at least, almost so.  What say you, Marianne?""I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now.  Whenyou tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfectionin his face, than I now do in his heart."Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth shehad been betrayed into, in speaking of him.  She felt that Edward stoodvery high in her opinion.  She believed the regard to be mutual; butshe required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction oftheir attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that what Marianne and hermother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them,to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect.  She tried to explainthe real state of the case to her sister."I do not attempt to deny," said she, "that I think very highly ofhim--that I greatly esteem, that I like him."Marianne here burst forth with indignation--"Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!  worse thancold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.  Use those words again, and Iwill leave the room this moment."Elinor could not help laughing.  "Excuse me," said she; "and be assuredthat I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of myown feelings.  Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion--thehope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly.But farther than this you must not believe.  I am by no means assuredof his regard for me.  There are moments when the extent of it seemsdoubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder atmy wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, bybelieving or calling it more than it is.  In my heart I feellittle--scarcely any doubt of his preference.  But there are otherpoints to be considered besides his inclination.  He is very far frombeing independent.  What his mother really is we cannot know; but, fromFanny's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have neverbeen disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken ifEdward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties inhis way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a greatfortune or high rank."Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her motherand herself had outstripped the truth."And you really are not engaged to him!" said she.  "Yet it certainlysoon will happen.  But two advantages will proceed from this delay.  Ishall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity ofimproving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must beso indispensably necessary to your future felicity.  Oh! if he shouldbe so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, howdelightful it would be!"Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.  She could notconsider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Mariannehad believed it.  There was, at times, a want of spirits about himwhich, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost asunpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need notgive him more than inquietude.  It would not be likely to produce thatdejection of mind which frequently attended him.  A more reasonablecause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade theindulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother neither behavedto him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give himany assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictlyattending to her views for his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledgeas this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.  Shewas far from depending on that result of his preference of her, whichher mother and sister still considered as certain.  Nay, the longerthey were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard;and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no morethan friendship.But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceivedby his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which wasstill more common,) to make her uncivil.  She took the firstopportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking toher so expressively of her brother's great expectations, of Mrs.Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of thedanger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; thatMrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor tobe calm.  She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, andinstantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be theinconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinorshould not be exposed another week to such insinuations.In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from thepost, which contained a proposal particularly well timed.  It was theoffer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation ofher own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.  Theletter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spiritof friendly accommodation.  He understood that she was in need of adwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,he assured her that everything should be done to it which she mightthink necessary, if the situation pleased her.  He earnestly pressedher, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come withher daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, fromwhence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houseswere in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortableto her.  He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole ofhis letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail ofgiving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she wassuffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearerconnections.  She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry.  Herresolution was formed as she read.  The situation of Barton, in acounty so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hoursbefore, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh everypossible advantage belonging to the place, was now its firstrecommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer anevil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison ofthe misery of continuing her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove forever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit orvisit it while such a woman was its mistress.  She instantly wrote SirJohn Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptanceof his proposal; and then hastened to shew both letters to herdaughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before heranswer were sent.Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settleat some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their presentacquaintance.  On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to opposeher mother's intention of removing into Devonshire.  The house, too, asdescribed by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent souncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on eitherpoint; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charmto her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norlandbeyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother fromsending a letter of acquiescence.No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herselfin the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that shewas provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer than tillevery thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They heard her withsurprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly hopedthat she would not be settled far from Norland. She had greatsatisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edwardturned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of surpriseand concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated,"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And towhat part of it?" She explained the situation. It was within four milesnorthward of Exeter."It is but a cottage," she continued, "but I hope to see many of myfriends in it.  A room or two can easily be added; and if my friendsfind no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I willfind none in accommodating them."She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwoodto visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greateraffection.  Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law hadmade her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than wasunavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in thatpoint to which it principally tended.  To separate Edward and Elinorwas as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs.John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totallyshe disregarded her disapprobation of the match.Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorryhe was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as toprevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture.  Hereally felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the veryexertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to hisfather was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniturewas all sent around by water.  It chiefly consisted of household linen,plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's.Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could nothelp feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income would be sotrifling in comparison with their own, she should have any handsomearticle of furniture.Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished,and she might have immediate possession.  No difficulty arose on eitherside in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of hereffects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before sheset off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in theperformance of everything that interested her, was soon done.--Thehorses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after hisdeath, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage,she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldestdaughter.  For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only herown wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinorprevailed.  HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants tothree; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided fromamongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire,to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as LadyMiddleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred goingdirectly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and sherelied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as tofeel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own.Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution bythe evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of herremoval; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealedunder a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.  Now was thetime when her son-in-law's promise to his father might with particularpropriety be fulfilled.  Since he had neglected to do it on firstcoming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on asthe most suitable period for its accomplishment.  But Mrs. Dashwoodbegan shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced,from the general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extendedno farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.  He sofrequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and ofthe perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence inthe world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather tostand in need of more money himself than to have any design of givingmoney away.In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton'sfirst letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their futureabode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin theirjourney.Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place somuch beloved.  "Dear, dear Norland!" said Marianne, as she wanderedalone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; "whenshall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from thisspot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you, yewell-known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decaybecause we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although wecan observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same; unconsciousof the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of anychange in those who walk under your shade!--But who will remain toenjoy you?"The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy adisposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant.  But as theydrew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of acountry which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a viewof Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.  It was apleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture.  After windingalong it for more than a mile, they reached their own house.  A smallgreen court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicketgate admitted them into it.As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, theroof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor werethe walls covered with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directlythrough the house into the garden behind.  On each side of the entrancewas a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were theoffices and the stairs.  Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the restof the house.  It had not been built many years and was in good repair.In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but the tearswhich recollection called forth as they entered the house were soondried away.  They were cheered by the joy of the servants on theirarrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from firstseeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received animpression in its favour which was of material service in recommendingit to their lasting approbation.The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose immediatelybehind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were opendowns, the others cultivated and woody.  The village of Barton waschiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from thecottage windows.  The prospect in front was more extensive; itcommanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in thatdirection; under another name, and in another course, it branched outagain between two of the steepest of them.With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon thewhole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered manyadditions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was adelight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supplyall that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.  "As for thehouse itself, to be sure," said she, "it is too small for our family,but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as itis too late in the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring, if Ihave plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think aboutbuilding.  These parlors are both too small for such parties of ourfriends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughtsof throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of theother, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this,with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamberand garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage.  I couldwish the stairs were handsome.  But one must not expect every thing;though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them.  Ishall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, andwe will plan our improvements accordingly."In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from thesavings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never savedin her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as itwas; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns,and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, toform themselves a home.  Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked andproperly disposed of; and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the wallsof their sitting room.In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfastthe next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcomethem to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his ownhouse and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.  SirJohn Middleton was a good looking man about forty.  He had formerlyvisited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins toremember him.  His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and hismanners were as friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arrivalseemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be anobject of real solicitude to him.  He said much of his earnest desireof their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressedthem so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they werebetter settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to apoint of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence.His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after heleft them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived fromthe park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present ofgame.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to andfrom the post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction ofsending them his newspaper every day.Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting herintention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assuredthat her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message wasanswered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introducedto them the next day.They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much oftheir comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearancewas favourable to their wishes.  Lady Middleton was not more than sixor seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall andstriking, and her address graceful.  Her manners had all the elegancewhich her husband's wanted.  But they would have been improved by someshare of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough todetract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, thoughperfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say forherself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, andLady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her theireldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which meansthere was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case ofextremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty,and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hungabout her and held down his head, to the great surprise of herladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he couldmake noise enough at home.  On every formal visit a child ought to beof the party, by way of provision for discourse.  In the present caseit took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like hisfather or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for ofcourse every body differed, and every body was astonished at theopinion of the others.An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on therest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house withoutsecuring their promise of dining at the park the next day.Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.  The ladies hadpassed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened fromtheir view at home by the projection of a hill.  The house was largeand handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitalityand elegance.  The former was for Sir John's gratification, the latterfor that of his lady.  They were scarcely ever without some friendsstaying with them in the house, and they kept more company of everykind than any other family in the neighbourhood.  It was necessary tothe happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outwardbehaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want oftalent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected withsuch as society produced, within a very narrow compass.  Sir John was asportsman, Lady Middleton a mother.  He hunted and shot, and shehumoured her children; and these were their only resources.  LadyMiddleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all theyear round, while Sir John's independent employments were in existenceonly half the time.  Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported thegood spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of hiswife.Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and ofall her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was hergreatest enjoyment in any of their parties.  But Sir John'ssatisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collectingabout him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisierthey were the better was he pleased.  He was a blessing to all thejuvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for everforming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winterhis private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was notsuffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joyto him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitantshe had now procured for his cottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods wereyoung, pretty, and unaffected.  It was enough to secure his goodopinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want tomake her mind as captivating as her person.  The friendliness of hisdisposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situationmight be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  Inshowing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfactionof a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in hiscottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, isnot often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to aresidence within his own manor.Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house bySir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity;and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the youngladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the daybefore, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.  Theywould see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; aparticular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither veryyoung nor very gay.  He hoped they would all excuse the smallness ofthe party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.  Hehad been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring someaddition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was fullof engagements.  Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Bartonwithin the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman,he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they mightimagine.  The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectlysatisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished forno more.Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry,fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, andrather vulgar.  She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinnerwas over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers andhusbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.  Marianne wasvexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinorto see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gaveElinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place railleryas Mrs. Jennings's.Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted byresemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to behis wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother.  He wassilent and grave.  His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spiteof his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute oldbachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but thoughhis face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and hisaddress was particularly gentlemanlike.There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them ascompanions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middletonwas so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity ofColonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and hismother-in-law was interesting.  Lady Middleton seemed to be roused toenjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner,who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind ofdiscourse except what related to themselves.In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she wasinvited to play.  The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared tobe charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request wentthrough the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought intothe family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since inthe same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebratedthat event by giving up music, although by her mother's account, shehad played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.Marianne's performance was highly applauded.  Sir John was loud in hisadmiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversationwith the others while every song lasted.  Lady Middleton frequentlycalled him to order, wondered how any one's attention could be divertedfrom music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular songwhich Marianne had just finished.  Colonel Brandon alone, of all theparty, heard her without being in raptures.  He paid her only thecompliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on theoccasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shamelesswant of taste.  His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to thatecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, wasestimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of theothers; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five andthirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and everyexquisite power of enjoyment.  She was perfectly disposed to make everyallowance for the colonel's advanced state of life which humanityrequired.Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.  She had only twodaughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, andshe had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of theworld.  In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, asfar as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projectingweddings among all the young people of her acquaintance.  She wasremarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed theadvantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady byinsinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind ofdiscernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively topronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with MarianneDashwood.  She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first eveningof their being together, from his listening so attentively while shesang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons' diningat the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.It must be so.  She was perfectly convinced of it.  It would be anexcellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE was handsome.  Mrs. Jenningshad been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since herconnection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge; and shewas always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, forit supplied her with endless jokes against them both.  At the park shelaughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne.  To the formerher raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at firstincomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knewwhether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel'sadvanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger thanherself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy ofher daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability ofwishing to throw ridicule on his age."But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured.  Colonel Brandonis certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MYfather; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must havelong outlived every sensation of the kind.  It is too ridiculous!  Whenis a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will notprotect him?""Infirmity!" said Elinor, "do you call Colonel Brandon infirm?  I caneasily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to mymother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use ofhis limbs!""Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?  and is not that thecommonest infirmity of declining life?""My dearest child," said her mother, laughing, "at this rate you mustbe in continual terror of MY decay; and it must seem to you a miraclethat my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.""Mama, you are not doing me justice.  I know very well that ColonelBrandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive oflosing him in the course of nature.  He may live twenty years longer.But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.""Perhaps," said Elinor, "thirty-five and seventeen had better not haveany thing to do with matrimony together.  But if there should by anychance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I shouldnot think Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to hismarrying HER.""A woman of seven and twenty," said Marianne, after pausing a moment,"can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home beuncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bringherself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of theprovision and security of a wife.  In his marrying such a womantherefore there would be nothing unsuitable.  It would be a compact ofconvenience, and the world would be satisfied.  In my eyes it would beno marriage at all, but that would be nothing.  To me it would seemonly a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at theexpense of the other.""It would be impossible, I know," replied Elinor, "to convince you thata woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-fiveanything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to theconstant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced tocomplain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel inone of his shoulders.""But he talked of flannel waistcoats," said Marianne; "and with me aflannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old andthe feeble.""Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised himhalf so much.  Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting toyou in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?"Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the room, "Mama," saidMarianne, "I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannotconceal from you.  I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well.  We have nowbeen here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come.  Nothing butreal indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.  What elsecan detain him at Norland?""Had you any idea of his coming so soon?" said Mrs. Dashwood.  "I hadnone.  On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on thesubject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want ofpleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of hiscoming to Barton.  Does Elinor expect him already?""I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.""I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to heryesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observedthat there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that theroom would be wanted for some time.""How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!  But the whole oftheir behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, howcomposed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation thelast evening of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was nodistinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of anaffectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave them purposelytogether in the course of the last morning, and each time did he mostunaccountably follow me out of the room.  And Elinor, in quittingNorland and Edward, cried not as I did.  Even now her self-command isinvariable.  When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try toavoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?"The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort tothemselves.  The house and the garden, with all the objects surroundingthem, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which hadgiven to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greaterenjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of theirfather.  Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the firstfortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation athome, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, inspite of Sir John's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in theneighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always attheir service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame thewish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining tovisit any family beyond the distance of a walk.  There were but few whocould be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow windingvalley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerlydescribed, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered anancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a littleof Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to bebetter acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry, that itspossessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunatelytoo infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.  The highdowns which invited them from almost every window of the cottage toseek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happyalternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superiorbeauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret onememorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshineof a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which thesettled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned.  The weather wasnot tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and theirbook, in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would belastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn offfrom their hills; and the two girls set off together.They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration atevery glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces theanimating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fearswhich had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing suchdelightful sensations."Is there a felicity in the world," said Marianne, "superior tothis?--Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours."Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resistingit with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenlythe clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full intheir face.-- Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, thoughunwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their ownhouse.  One consolation however remained for them, to which theexigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that ofrunning with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill whichled immediately to their garden gate.They set off.  Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false stepbrought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stopherself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached thebottom in safety.A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, waspassing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when heraccident happened.  He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.  Shehad raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted inher fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.  The gentleman offeredhis services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what hersituation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without fartherdelay, and carried her down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directlyinto the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not hishold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and whilethe eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secretadmiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized forhis intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and sograceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, receivedadditional charms from his voice and expression.  Had he been even old,ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood wouldhave been secured by any act of attention to her child; but theinfluence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to theaction which came home to her feelings.She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address whichalways attended her, invited him to be seated.  But this he declined,as he was dirty and wet.  Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom shewas obliged.  His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his presenthome was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him thehonour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood.  The honourwas readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still moreinteresting, in the midst of a heavy rain.His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly thetheme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raisedagainst Marianne received particular spirit from his exteriorattractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his Mama therest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his liftingher up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after theirentering the house.  But she had seen enough of him to join in all theadmiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned herpraise.  His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawnfor the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into thehouse with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity ofthought which particularly recommended the action to her.  Everycircumstance belonging to him was interesting.  His name was good, hisresidence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out thatof all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.  Herimagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of asprained ankle was disregarded.Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weatherthat morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne's accidentbeing related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew anygentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham."Willoughby!" cried Sir John; "what, is HE in the country? That is goodnews however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner onThursday.""You know him then," said Mrs. Dashwood."Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here every year.""And what sort of a young man is he?""As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.  A very decentshot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.""And is that all you can say for him?" cried Marianne, indignantly."But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What hispursuits, his talents, and genius?"Sir John was rather puzzled."Upon my soul," said he, "I do not know much about him as to all THAT.But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicestlittle black bitch of a pointer I ever saw.  Was she out with himtoday?"But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.Willoughby's pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of hismind."But who is he?" said Elinor.  "Where does he come from?  Has he ahouse at Allenham?"On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and hetold them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in thecountry; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old ladyat Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he wasto inherit; adding, "Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I cantell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own inSomersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to myyounger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.  MissMarianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.  Brandon willbe jealous, if she does not take care.""I do not believe," said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MYdaughters towards what you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employmentto which they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us, letthem be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however, from what you say,that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will notbe ineligible.""He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived," repeatedSir John.  "I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, hedanced from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down.""Did he indeed?" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, "and withelegance, with spirit?""Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.""That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be.  Whateverbe his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, andleave him no sense of fatigue.""Aye, aye, I see how it will be," said Sir John, "I see how it will be.You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poorBrandon.""That is an expression, Sir John," said Marianne, warmly, "which Iparticularly dislike.  I abhor every common-place phrase by which witis intended; and 'setting one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,'are the most odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal; andif their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long agodestroyed all its ingenuity."Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed asheartily as if he did, and then replied,"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other.Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worthsetting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumblingabout and spraining of ankles."Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to makehis personal enquiries.  He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with morethan politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him andher own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during thevisit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introducedhim.  Of their personal charms he had not required a second interviewto be convinced.Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and aremarkably pretty figure.  Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form,though not so correct as her sister's, in having the advantage ofheight, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in thecommon cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was lessviolently outraged than usually happens.  Her skin was very brown, but,from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; herfeatures were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in hereyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness,which could hardily be seen without delight.  From Willoughby theirexpression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which theremembrance of his assistance created.  But when this passed away, whenher spirits became collected, when she saw that to the perfectgood-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, andabove all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he waspassionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as securedthe largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay.It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage herto talk.  She could not be silent when such points were introduced, andshe had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.  They speedilydiscovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, andthat it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that relatedto either.  Encouraged by this to a further examination of hisopinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; herfavourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturousa delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have beeninsensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellenceof such works, however disregarded before.  Their taste was strikinglyalike.  The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--or ifany difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer thantill the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could bedisplayed.  He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all herenthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they conversed withthe familiarity of a long-established acquaintance."Well, Marianne," said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, "for ONEmorning I think you have done pretty well.  You have alreadyascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter ofimportance.  You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you arecertain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you havereceived every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under suchextraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?  You will soonhave exhausted each favourite topic.  Another meeting will suffice toexplain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, andthen you can have nothing farther to ask."--"Elinor," cried Marianne, "is this fair? is this just? are my ideas soscanty?  But I see what you mean.  I have been too much at my ease, toohappy, too frank.  I have erred against every common-place notion ofdecorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have beenreserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had I talked only of theweather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, thisreproach would have been spared.""My love," said her mother, "you must not be offended with Elinor--shewas only in jest.  I should scold her myself, if she were capable ofwishing to check the delight of your conversation with our newfriend."-- Marianne was softened in a moment.Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in theiracquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer.  Hecame to them every day.  To enquire after Marianne was at first hisexcuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day gavegreater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceasedto be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery.  She was confined forsome days to the house; but never had any confinement been lessirksome.  Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quickimagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners.  He wasexactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joinednot only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which wasnow roused and increased by the example of her own, and whichrecommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.  They read,they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were considerable;and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward hadunfortunately wanted.In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne's; andElinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which hestrongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying toomuch what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons orcircumstances.  In hastily forming and giving his opinion of otherpeople, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undividedattention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily theforms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinorcould not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say inits support.Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seizedher at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy herideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby wasall that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in everybrighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviourdeclared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilitieswere strong.Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of theirmarriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before theend of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulateherself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so early beendiscovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, whenit ceased to be noticed by them.  Their attention and wit were drawnoff to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other hadincurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelingsbegan really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentimentswhich Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were nowactually excited by her sister; and that however a general resemblanceof disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was nohindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern;for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to avery lively one of five and twenty? and as she could not even wish himsuccessful, she heartily wished him indifferent.  She liked him--inspite of his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object ofinterest.  His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserveappeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of anynatural gloominess of temper.  Sir John had dropped hints of pastinjuries and disappointments, which justified her belief of his beingan unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion.Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted byWilloughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neitherlively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits."Brandon is just the kind of man," said Willoughby one day, when theywere talking of him together, "whom every body speaks well of, andnobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembersto talk to.""That is exactly what I think of him," cried Marianne."Do not boast of it, however," said Elinor, "for it is injustice inboth of you.  He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, andI never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.""That he is patronised by YOU," replied Willoughby, "is certainly inhis favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach initself.  Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such awoman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command theindifference of any body else?""But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne willmake amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother.  If theirpraise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not moreundiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.""In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.""My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will alwayshave attractions for me.  Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirtyand forty.  He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad, hasread, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him capable of giving memuch information on various subjects; and he has always answered myinquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.""That is to say," cried Marianne contemptuously, "he has told you, thatin the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes aretroublesome.""He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries,but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed.""Perhaps," said Willoughby, "his observations may have extended to theexistence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.""I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much furtherthan your candour.  But why should you dislike him?""I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary, as a veryrespectable man, who has every body's good word, and nobody's notice;who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how toemploy, and two new coats every year.""Add to which," cried Marianne, "that he has neither genius, taste, norspirit.  That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings noardour, and his voice no expression.""You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass," replied Elinor,"and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that thecommendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold andinsipid.  I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiableheart.""Miss Dashwood," cried Willoughby, "you are now using me unkindly.  Youare endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against mywill.  But it will not do.  You shall find me as stubborn as you can beartful.  I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking ColonelBrandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he hasfound fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade himto buy my brown mare.  If it will be any satisfaction to you, however,to be told, that I believe his character to be in other respectsirreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return for anacknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me theprivilege of disliking him as much as ever."Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first cameinto Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy theirtime as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have suchfrequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them littleleisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.  When Mariannewas recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which SirJohn had been previously forming, were put into execution.  The privateballs at the park then began; and parties on the water were made andaccomplished as often as a showery October would allow.  In everymeeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease andfamiliarity which naturally attended these parties were exactlycalculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with theDashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies ofMarianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of heraffection.Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.  She only wishedthat it were less openly shewn; and once or twice did venture tosuggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne.  But Marianneabhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselvesillaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but adisgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was anillustration of their opinions.When he was present she had no eyes for any one else.  Every thing hedid, was right.  Every thing he said, was clever.  If their evenings atthe park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the restof the party to get her a good hand.  If dancing formed the amusementof the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged toseparate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together andscarcely spoke a word to any body else.  Such conduct made them ofcourse most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, andseemed hardly to provoke them.Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which lefther no inclination for checking this excessive display of them.  To herit was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young andardent mind.This was the season of happiness to Marianne.  Her heart was devoted toWilloughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought withher from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought itpossible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on herpresent home.Elinor's happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not so much atease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure.  They affordedher no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret thanever.  Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her theconversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker,and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her alarge share of her discourse.  She had already repeated her own historyto Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been equal toher means of improvement, she might have known very early in theiracquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, andwhat he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.  Lady Middletonwas more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.  Elinorneeded little observation to perceive that her reserve was a merecalmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.  Towards herhusband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy wastherefore neither to be looked for nor desired.  She had nothing to sayone day that she had not said the day before.  Her insipidity wasinvariable, for even her spirits were always the same; and though shedid not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided everything were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her,she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she mighthave experienced in sitting at home;--and so little did her presenceadd to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation,that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by hersolicitude about her troublesome boys.In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor finda person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excitethe interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.Willoughby was out of the question.  Her admiration and regard, evenher sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; hisattentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man mighthave been more generally pleasing.  Colonel Brandon, unfortunately forhimself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and inconversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for theindifference of her sister.Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspectthat the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped fromhim one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together bymutual consent, while the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed onMarianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faintsmile, "Your sister, I understand, does not approve of secondattachments.""No," replied Elinor, "her opinions are all romantic.""Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.""I believe she does.  But how she contrives it without reflecting onthe character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not.A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis ofcommon sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to defineand to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.""This will probably be the case," he replied; "and yet there issomething so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one issorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.""I cannot agree with you there," said Elinor.  "There areinconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne's, which all thecharms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Hersystems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety atnought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forwardto as her greatest possible advantage."After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,--"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against asecond attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body?  Are thosewho have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from theinconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to beequally indifferent during the rest of their lives?""Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles.I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a secondattachment's being pardonable.""This," said he, "cannot hold; but a change, a total change ofsentiments--No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinementsof a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are theysucceeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous!  Ispeak from experience.  I once knew a lady who in temper and mindgreatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but whofrom an inforced change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances"--Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much,and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might nototherwise have entered Elinor's head.  The lady would probably havepassed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that whatconcerned her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was, it required buta slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tenderrecollection of past regard.  Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne,in her place, would not have done so little.  The whole story wouldhave been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thingestablished in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning thelatter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite ofall that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.  Marianne told her,with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, onethat he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which wasexactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering that it wasnot in her mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alterher resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for theservant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stableto receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, andtold her sister of it in raptures."He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,"she added, "and when it arrives we will ride every day.  You shallshare its use with me.  Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, thedelight of a gallop on some of these downs."Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity tocomprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and forsome time she refused to submit to them.  As to an additional servant,the expense would be a trifle; Mama she was sure would never object toit; and any horse would do for HIM; he might always get one at thepark; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.  Elinor thenventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from aman so little, or at least so lately known to her.  This was too much."You are mistaken, Elinor," said she warmly, "in supposing I know verylittle of Willoughby.  I have not known him long indeed, but I am muchbetter acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in theworld, except yourself and mama.  It is not time or opportunity that isto determine intimacy;--it is disposition alone.  Seven years would beinsufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and sevendays are more than enough for others.  I should hold myself guilty ofgreater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than fromWilloughby.  Of John I know very little, though we have lived togetherfor years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed."Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.  She knew hersister's temper.  Opposition on so tender a subject would only attachher the more to her own opinion.  But by an appeal to her affection forher mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgentmother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) sheconsented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortlysubdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudentkindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she sawhim next, that it must be declined.She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at thecottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment tohim in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of hispresent.  The reasons for this alteration were at the same timerelated, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his sideimpossible.  His concern however was very apparent; and afterexpressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice,--"But,Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now.  Ishall keep it only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton toform your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shallreceive you."This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of thesentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing hersister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy sodecided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement betweenthem.  From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to eachother; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, orany of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discoverit by accident.Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed thismatter in a still clearer light.  Willoughby had spent the precedingevening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlourwith only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations,which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldestsister, when they were next by themselves."Oh, Elinor!" she cried, "I have such a secret to tell you aboutMarianne.  I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.""You have said so," replied Elinor, "almost every day since they firstmet on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, Ibelieve, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture roundher neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our greatuncle.""But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure they will bemarried very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.""Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the hair of some great uncle ofHIS.""But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am almost sure it is, for Isaw him cut it off.  Last night after tea, when you and mama went outof the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as couldbe, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he tookup her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was alltumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece ofwhite paper; and put it into his pocket-book."For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could notwithhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstancewas in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactoryto her sister.  When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at thepark, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor's particularfavourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, "I must nottell, may I, Elinor?"This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.But the effort was painful.  She was convinced that Margaret had fixedon a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become astanding joke with Mrs. Jennings.Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than goodto the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner toMargaret,"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right torepeat them.""I never had any conjectures about it," replied Margaret; "it was youwho told me of it yourself."This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerlypressed to say something more."Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it," said Mrs.Jennings.  "What is the gentleman's name?""I must not tell, ma'am. But I know very well what it is; and I knowwhere he is too.""Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to besure.  He is the curate of the parish I dare say.""No, THAT he is not.  He is of no profession at all.""Margaret," said Marianne with great warmth, "you know that all this isan invention of your own, and that there is no such person inexistence.""Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was sucha man once, and his name begins with an F."Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at thismoment, "that it rained very hard," though she believed theinterruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from herladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery asdelighted her husband and mother.  The idea however started by her, wasimmediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasionmindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject ofrain by both of them.  Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and askedMarianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours ofdifferent people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.  But not soeasily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see avery fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to abrother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could notbe seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orderson that head.  The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, andSir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowedto be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, atleast, twice every summer for the last ten years.  They contained anoble piece of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of themorning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriagesonly to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of acomplete party of pleasure.To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for thelast fortnight;--and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, waspersuaded by Elinor to stay at home.Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different fromwhat Elinor had expected.  She was prepared to be wet through,fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, forthey did not go at all.By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where theywere to breakfast.  The morning was rather favourable, though it hadrained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,and the sun frequently appeared.  They were all in high spirits andgood humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to thegreatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in.  Among therest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he took it, looked at thedirection, changed colour, and immediately left the room."What is the matter with Brandon?" said Sir John.Nobody could tell."I hope he has had no bad news," said Lady Middleton.  "It must besomething extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave mybreakfast table so suddenly."In about five minutes he returned."No bad news, Colonel, I hope;" said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as heentered the room."None at all, ma'am, I thank you.""Was it from Avignon?  I hope it is not to say that your sister isworse.""No, ma'am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.""But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only aletter of business?  Come, come, this won't do, Colonel; so let us hearthe truth of it.""My dear madam," said Lady Middleton, "recollect what you are saying.""Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?" saidMrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter's reproof."No, indeed, it is not.""Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.  And I hope she is well.""Whom do you mean, ma'am?" said he, colouring a little."Oh! you know who I mean.""I am particularly sorry, ma'am," said he, addressing Lady Middleton,"that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business whichrequires my immediate attendance in town.""In town!" cried Mrs. Jennings.  "What can you have to do in town atthis time of year?""My own loss is great," he continued, "in being obliged to leave soagreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presenceis necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell."What a blow upon them all was this!"But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon," saidMarianne, eagerly, "will it not be sufficient?"He shook his head."We must go," said Sir John.--"It shall not be put off when we are sonear it.  You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.""I wish it could be so easily settled.  But it is not in my power todelay my journey for one day!""If you would but let us know what your business is," said Mrs.Jennings, "we might see whether it could be put off or not.""You would not be six hours later," said Willoughby, "if you were todefer your journey till our return.""I cannot afford to lose ONE hour."--Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, "Thereare some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.  Brandon is one ofthem.  He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented thistrick for getting out of it.  I would lay fifty guineas the letter wasof his own writing.""I have no doubt of it," replied Marianne."There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know ofold," said Sir John, "when once you are determined on anything.  But,however, I hope you will think better of it.  Consider, here are thetwo Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walkedup from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before hisusual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell."Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause ofdisappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to beunavoidable."Well, then, when will you come back again?""I hope we shall see you at Barton," added her ladyship, "as soon asyou can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party toWhitwell till you return.""You are very obliging.  But it is so uncertain, when I may have it inmy power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.""Oh! he must and shall come back," cried Sir John.  "If he is not hereby the end of the week, I shall go after him.""Ay, so do, Sir John," cried Mrs. Jennings, "and then perhaps you mayfind out what his business is.""I do not want to pry into other men's concerns.  I suppose it issomething he is ashamed of."Colonel Brandon's horses were announced."You do not go to town on horseback, do you?" added Sir John."No. Only to Honiton.  I shall then go post.""Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey.  But youhad better change your mind.""I assure you it is not in my power."He then took leave of the whole party."Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town thiswinter, Miss Dashwood?""I am afraid, none at all.""Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish todo."To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing."Come Colonel," said Mrs. Jennings, "before you go, do let us know whatyou are going about."He wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the room.The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hithertorestrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again andagain how provoking it was to be so disappointed."I can guess what his business is, however," said Mrs. Jenningsexultingly."Can you, ma'am?" said almost every body."Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.""And who is Miss Williams?" asked Marianne."What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must haveheard of her before.  She is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; avery near relation.  We will not say how near, for fear of shocking theyoung ladies." Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,"She is his natural daughter.""Indeed!""Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.  I dare say the Colonelwill leave her all his fortune."When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regreton so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that asthey were all got together, they must do something by way of beinghappy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that althoughhappiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure atolerable composure of mind by driving about the country.  Thecarriages were then ordered; Willoughby's was first, and Marianne neverlooked happier than when she got into it.  He drove through the parkvery fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of themwas seen till their return, which did not happen till after the returnof all the rest.  They both seemed delighted with their drive; but saidonly in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the otherswent on the downs.It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and thatevery body should be extremely merry all day long.  Some more of theCareys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearlytwenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not been longseated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said toMarianne, loud enough for them both to hear, "I have found you out inspite of all your tricks.  I know where you spent the morning."Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, "Where, pray?"--"Did not you know," said Willoughby, "that we had been out in mycurricle?""Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determinedto find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house, MissMarianne.  It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you,I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much whenI was there six years ago."Marianne turned away in great confusion.  Mrs. Jennings laughedheartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where theyhad been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.Willoughby's groom; and that she had by that method been informed thatthey had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there inwalking about the garden and going all over the house.Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikelythat Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the housewhile Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallestacquaintance.As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstancerelated by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angrywith her for doubting it."Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that wedid not see the house?  Is not it what you have often wished to doyourself?""Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and withno other companion than Mr. Willoughby.""Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shewthat house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible tohave any other companion.  I never spent a pleasanter morning in mylife.""I am afraid," replied Elinor, "that the pleasantness of an employmentdoes not always evince its propriety.""On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for ifthere had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have beensensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are actingwrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.""But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some veryimpertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion ofyour own conduct?""If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof ofimpropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives.I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation.  Iam not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs.Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house.  They will one day be Mr.Willoughby's, and--""If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not bejustified in what you have done."She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her;and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought, she came to hersister again, and said with great good humour, "Perhaps, Elinor, it WASrather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wantedparticularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assureyou.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nicecomfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it wouldbe delightful.  It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.  Onone side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to abeautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the churchand village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have sooften admired.  I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could bemore forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up--acouple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of thepleasantest summer-rooms in England."Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others,she would have described every room in the house with equal delight.The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with hissteadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised thewonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a greatwonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in allthe comings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She wondered, withlittle intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there mustbe some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that couldhave befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escapethem all."Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure," said she."I could see it in his face.  Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstancesmay be bad.  The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than twothousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.  I dothink he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else canit be?  I wonder whether it is so.  I would give anything to know thetruth of it.  Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I daresay it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.  May beshe is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have anotion she is always rather sickly.  I would lay any wager it is aboutMiss Williams.  It is not so very likely he should be distressed in hiscircumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure musthave cleared the estate by this time.  I wonder what it can be!  May behis sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His settingoff in such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out of allhis trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain."So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion varying with everyfresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of ColonelBrandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away,which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides that thecircumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement orvariety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It wasengrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby onthe subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to themall.  As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strangeand more incompatible with the disposition of both.  Why they shouldnot openly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constantbehaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could notimagine.She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately intheir power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reasonto believe him rich.  His estate had been rated by Sir John at aboutsix or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which thatincome could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained ofhis poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by themrelative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all,she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to theirgeneral opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mindof their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent hermaking any inquiry of Marianne.Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, thanWilloughby's behaviour.  To Marianne it had all the distinguishingtenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of thefamily it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  Thecottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many moreof his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no generalengagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called himout in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the restof the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by hisfavourite pointer at her feet.One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left thecountry, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling ofattachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's happeningto mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmlyopposed every alteration of a place which affection had established asperfect with him."What!" he exclaimed--"Improve this dear cottage!  No. THAT I willnever consent to.  Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inchto its size, if my feelings are regarded.""Do not be alarmed," said Miss Dashwood, "nothing of the kind will bedone; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.""I am heartily glad of it," he cried.  "May she always be poor, if shecan employ her riches no better.""Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I would notsacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any onewhom I loved, for all the improvements in the world.  Depend upon itthat whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts inthe spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of itin a manner so painful to you.  But are you really so attached to thisplace as to see no defect in it?""I am," said he.  "To me it is faultless.  Nay, more, I consider it asthe only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were Irich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again inthe exact plan of this cottage.""With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose," saidElinor."Yes," cried he in the same eager tone, "with all and every thingbelonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about it,should the least variation be perceptible.  Then, and then only, undersuch a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been atBarton.""I flatter myself," replied Elinor, "that even under the disadvantageof better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find yourown house as faultless as you now do this.""There certainly are circumstances," said Willoughby, "which mightgreatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim ofmy affection, which no other can possibly share."Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes werefixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well sheunderstood him."How often did I wish," added he, "when I was at Allenham this timetwelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited!  I never passed withinview of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no oneshould live in it.  How little did I then think that the very firstnews I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediatesatisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind ofprescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can accountfor.  Must it not have been so, Marianne?" speaking to her in a loweredvoice.  Then continuing his former tone, he said, "And yet this houseyou would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it of its simplicity byimaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintancefirst began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent byus together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,and every body would be eager to pass through the room which hashitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfortthan any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the worldcould possibly afford."Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind shouldbe attempted."You are a good woman," he warmly replied.  "Your promise makes meeasy.  Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy.  Tell methat not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall everfind you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you willalways consider me with the kindness which has made everythingbelonging to you so dear to me."The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's behaviour during thewhole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness."Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?" said Mrs. Dashwood, when he wasleaving them.  "I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we mustwalk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton."He engaged to be with them by four o'clock.Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, andtwo of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself frombeing of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and hermother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby thenight before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectlysatisfied with her remaining at home.On their return from the park they found Willoughby's curricle andservant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced thather conjecture had been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught herto expect.  They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne camehastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with herhandkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she hadjust quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning againstthe mantel-piece with his back towards them.  He turned round on theircoming in, and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of theemotion which over-powered Marianne."Is anything the matter with her?" cried Mrs. Dashwood as sheentered--"is she ill?""I hope not," he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forcedsmile presently added, "It is I who may rather expect to be ill--for Iam now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!""Disappointment?""Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.  Mrs. Smith hasthis morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependentcousin, by sending me on business to London.  I have just received mydispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way ofexhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.""To London!--and are you going this morning?""Almost this moment.""This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and herbusiness will not detain you from us long I hope."He coloured as he replied, "You are very kind, but I have no idea ofreturning into Devonshire immediately.  My visits to Mrs. Smith arenever repeated within the twelvemonth.""And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only house in theneighbourhood to which you will be welcome?  For shame, Willoughby, canyou wait for an invitation here?"His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he onlyreplied, "You are too good."Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.  Elinor felt equalamazement.  For a few moments every one was silent.  Mrs. Dashwoodfirst spoke."I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage youwill always be welcome; for I will not press you to return hereimmediately, because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasingto Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to questionyour judgment than to doubt your inclination.""My engagements at present," replied Willoughby, confusedly, "are ofsuch a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself"--He stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and anotherpause succeeded.  This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faintsmile, "It is folly to linger in this manner.  I will not tormentmyself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it isimpossible for me now to enjoy."He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room.  They saw himstep into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted theparlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which thissudden departure occasioned.Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's.  She thought ofwhat had just passed with anxiety and distrust.  Willoughby's behaviourin taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation ofcheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother'sinvitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself,greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared that no serious designhad ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunatequarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress inwhich Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel couldmost reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne'slove for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister'saffliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderestcompassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probabilitynot merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as aduty.In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes werered, her countenance was not uncheerful."Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor," said she,as she sat down to work, "and with how heavy a heart does he travel?""It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the workof a moment.  And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, soaffectionate?  And now, after only ten minutes notice--Gone too withoutintending to return!--Something more than what he owned to us must havehappened.  He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.  YOU musthave seen the difference as well as I.  What can it be?  Can they havequarrelled?  Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to acceptyour invitation here?"--"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly seeTHAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.  I have thought it allover I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that atfirst seemed strange to me as well as to you.""Can you, indeed!""Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--butyou, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy YOU,I know; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I ampersuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapprovesof it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on thataccount is eager to get him away;--and that the business which shesends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.This is what I believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware thatshe DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at presentconfess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himselfobliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, andabsent himself from Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil,unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affairas satisfactory at this.  And now, Elinor, what have you to say?""Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.""Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened.Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings!  You had rathertake evil upon credit than good.  You had rather look out for miseryfor Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for thelatter.  You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leaveof us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn.  And isno allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed byrecent disappointment?  Are no probabilities to be accepted, merelybecause they are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom wehave all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think illof?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, thoughunavoidably secret for a while?  And, after all, what is it you suspecthim of?""I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of something unpleasant isthe inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessedin him.  There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged ofthe allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to becandid in my judgment of every body.  Willoughby may undoubtedly havevery sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them atonce.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering atits being practiced by him.""Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where thedeviation is necessary.  But you really do admit the justice of what Ihave said in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.""Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if theyARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--and if that is the case, it must behighly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire atpresent.  But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.""Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby andMarianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes havebeen reproaching them every day for incautiousness.""I want no proof of their affection," said Elinor; "but of theirengagement I do.""I am perfectly satisfied of both.""Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either ofthem.""I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly.  Hasnot his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the lastfortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his futurewife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?Have we not perfectly understood each other?  Has not my consent beendaily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionaterespect?  My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement?  Howcould such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed thatWilloughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister's love, should leaveher, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of hisaffection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange ofconfidence?""I confess," replied Elinor, "that every circumstance except ONE is infavour of their engagement; but that ONE is the total silence of bothon the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.""How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt thenature of the terms on which they are together.  Has he been acting apart in his behaviour to your sister all this time?  Do you suppose himreally indifferent to her?""No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her I am sure.""But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with suchindifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him.""You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered thismatter as certain.  I have had my doubts, I confess; but they arefainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away.  If wefind they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.""A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see them at the altar, youwould suppose they were going to be married.  Ungracious girl!  But Irequire no such proof.  Nothing in my opinion has ever passed tojustify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformlyopen and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.  It mustbe Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?  Is he not a man ofhonour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side tocreate alarm? can he be deceitful?""I hope not, I believe not," cried Elinor.  "I love Willoughby,sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be morepainful to yourself than to me.  It has been involuntary, and I willnot encourage it.  I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in hismanners this morning;--he did not speak like himself, and did notreturn your kindness with any cordiality.  But all this may beexplained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed.  Hehad just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatestaffliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet awarethat by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away forsome time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part byour family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such acase, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been moreto his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his generalcharacter;--but I will not raise objections against any one's conducton so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.""You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does not deserve to besuspected.  Though WE have not known him long, he is no stranger inthis part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledgingeverything to me at once: but this is not the case.  It is anengagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriagemust be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as itcan be observed, may now be very advisable."They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was thenat liberty to think over the representations of her mother, toacknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered theroom and took her place at the table without saying a word.  Her eyeswere red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even thenrestrained with difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all, couldneither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother's silentlypressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of fortitudewas quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening.  Shewas without any power, because she was without any desire of commandover herself.  The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughbyoverpowered her in an instant; and though her family were mostanxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if theyspoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelingsconnected with him.Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been ableto sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby.  Shewould have been ashamed to look her family in the face the nextmorning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose thanwhen she lay down in it.  But the feelings which made such composure adisgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it.  She was awake thewhole night, and she wept the greatest part of it.  She got up with aheadache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding allattempt at consolation from either.  Her sensibility was potent enough!When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered aboutthe village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoymentand crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.  She playedover every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby,every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat atthe instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written outfor her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could begained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied.  She spentwhole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her voiceoften totally suspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as inmusic, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past andpresent was certain of giving.  She read nothing but what they had beenused to read together.Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; itsunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments,to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and silent meditations,still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy.  But Mrs.Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which atleast satisfied herself."Remember, Elinor," said she, "how very often Sir John fetches ourletters himself from the post, and carries them to it.  We have alreadyagreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that itcould not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass throughSir John's hands."Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it amotive sufficient for their silence.  But there was one method sodirect, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the realstate of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that shecould not help suggesting it to her mother."Why do you not ask Marianne at once," said she, "whether she is or sheis not engaged to Willoughby?  From you, her mother, and so kind, soindulgent a mother, the question could not give offence.  It would bethe natural result of your affection for her.  She used to be allunreserve, and to you more especially.""I would not ask such a question for the world.  Supposing it possiblethat they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiryinflict!  At any rate it would be most ungenerous.  I should neverdeserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession ofwhat is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.  I knowMarianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall notbe the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances makethe revealment of it eligible.  I would not attempt to force theconfidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of dutywould prevent the denial which her wishes might direct."Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister'syouth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, commoncare, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romanticdelicacy.It was several days before Willoughby's name was mentioned beforeMarianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, werenot so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--butone evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume ofShakespeare, exclaimed,"We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went awaybefore we could get through it.  We will put it by, that when he comesagain...But it may be months, perhaps, before THAT happens.""Months!" cried Marianne, with strong surprise.  "No--nor many weeks."Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said; but it gave Elinorpleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive ofconfidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions.One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne wasprevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead ofwandering away by herself.  Hitherto she had carefully avoided everycompanion in her rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on thedowns, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of thevalley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never befound when the others set off.  But at length she was secured by theexertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied withgaining one point, would not then attempt more.  Beyond the entrance ofthe valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild andmore open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on firstcoming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, theystopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed thedistance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they hadnever happened to reach in any of their walks before.Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one;it was a man on horseback riding towards them.  In a few minutes theycould distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwardsMarianne rapturously exclaimed,"It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!"--and was hastening to meethim, when Elinor cried out,"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is not Willoughby.The person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.""He has, he has," cried Marianne, "I am sure he has.  His air, hiscoat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come."She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne fromparticularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby,quickened her pace and kept up with her.  They were soon within thirtyyards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again; her heart sunk withinher; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voicesof both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as wellknown as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop, and sheturned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.He was the only person in the world who could at that moment beforgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained asmile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in hersister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back withthem to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially byMarianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him thaneven Elinor herself.  To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edwardand her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldnesswhich she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.  OnEdward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that alover ought to look and say on such an occasion.  He was confused,seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neitherrapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him byquestions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.  Mariannesaw and listened with increasing surprise.  She began almost to feel adislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, bycarrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed acontrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiriesof meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London.  No,he had been in Devonshire a fortnight."A fortnight!" she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the samecounty with Elinor without seeing her before.He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying withsome friends near Plymouth."Have you been lately in Sussex?" said Elinor."I was at Norland about a month ago.""And how does dear, dear Norland look?" cried Marianne."Dear, dear Norland," said Elinor, "probably looks much as it alwaysdoes at this time of the year.  The woods and walks thickly coveredwith dead leaves.""Oh," cried Marianne, "with what transporting sensation have I formerlyseen them fall!  How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them drivenin showers about me by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season,the air altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.  Theyare seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much aspossible from the sight.""It is not every one," said Elinor, "who has your passion for deadleaves.""No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood.  ButSOMETIMES they are."--As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for afew moments;--but rousing herself again, "Now, Edward," said she,calling his attention to the prospect, "here is Barton valley.  Look upto it, and be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!  Did you eversee their equals?  To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods andplantations.  You may see the end of the house.  And there, beneaththat farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.""It is a beautiful country," he replied; "but these bottoms must bedirty in winter.""How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?""Because," replied he, smiling, "among the rest of the objects beforeme, I see a very dirty lane.""How strange!" said Marianne to herself as she walked on."Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the Middletons pleasantpeople?""No, not all," answered Marianne; "we could not be more unfortunatelysituated.""Marianne," cried her sister, "how can you say so? How can you be sounjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towardsus have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you forgot, Marianne,how many pleasant days we have owed to them?""No," said Marianne, in a low voice, "nor how many painful moments."Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to theirvisitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, bytalking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extortingfrom him occasional questions and remarks.  His coldness and reservemortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving toregulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, sheavoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated himas she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; for hiscoming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder.  He receivedthe kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could notstand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him before heentered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivatingmanners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man could not very well be in lovewith either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; andElinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more likehimself.  His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and hisinterest in their welfare again became perceptible.  He was not inspirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, wasattentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits.  The whole familyperceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want ofliberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against allselfish parents."What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present, Edward?" said she,when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; "are you stillto be a great orator in spite of yourself?""No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents thaninclination for a public life!""But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be tosatisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, noaffection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may findit a difficult matter.""I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be distinguished; and haveevery reason to hope I never shall.  Thank Heaven! I cannot be forcedinto genius and eloquence.""You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes are all moderate.""As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe.  I wish aswell as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every bodyelse it must be in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.""Strange that it would!" cried Marianne.  "What have wealth or grandeurto do with happiness?""Grandeur has but little," said Elinor, "but wealth has much to do withit.""Elinor, for shame!" said Marianne, "money can only give happinesswhere there is nothing else to give it.  Beyond a competence, it canafford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.""Perhaps," said Elinor, smiling, "we may come to the same point.  YOURcompetence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and withoutthem, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind ofexternal comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas are only more noble thanmine.  Come, what is your competence?""About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than THAT."Elinor laughed.  "TWO thousand a year! ONE is my wealth! I guessed howit would end.""And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income," said Marianne."A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller.  I am sure I am notextravagant in my demands.  A proper establishment of servants, acarriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less."Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately theirfuture expenses at Combe Magna."Hunters!" repeated Edward--"but why must you have hunters?  Every bodydoes not hunt."Marianne coloured as she replied, "But most people do.""I wish," said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, "that somebodywould give us all a large fortune apiece!""Oh that they would!" cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling withanimation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginaryhappiness."We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose," said Elinor, "in spiteof the insufficiency of wealth.""Oh dear!" cried Margaret, "how happy I should be!  I wonder what Ishould do with it!"Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point."I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself," said Mrs.Dashwood, "if my children were all to be rich without my help.""You must begin your improvements on this house," observed Elinor, "andyour difficulties will soon vanish.""What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London," saidEdward, "in such an event!  What a happy day for booksellers,music-sellers, and print-shops!  You, Miss Dashwood, would give ageneral commission for every new print of merit to be sent you--and asfor Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be musicenough in London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy upevery copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands;and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an oldtwisted tree.  Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am verysaucy.  But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our olddisputes.""I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it be melancholy orgay, I love to recall it--and you will never offend me by talking offormer times.  You are very right in supposing how my money would bespent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly be employedin improving my collection of music and books.""And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on theauthors or their heirs.""No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.""Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person whowrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can everbe in love more than once in their life--your opinion on that point isunchanged, I presume?""Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.  It isnot likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.""Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see," said Elinor, "she is notat all altered.""She is only grown a little more grave than she was.""Nay, Edward," said Marianne, "you need not reproach me.  You are notvery gay yourself.""Why should you think so!" replied he, with a sigh.  "But gaiety neverwas a part of MY character.""Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's," said Elinor; "I should hardlycall her a lively girl--she is very earnest, very eager in all shedoes--sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation--but sheis not often really merry.""I believe you are right," he replied, "and yet I have always set herdown as a lively girl.""I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes," saidElinor, "in a total misapprehension of character in some point orother: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious orstupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what thedeception originated.  Sometimes one is guided by what they say ofthemselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.""But I thought it was right, Elinor," said Marianne, "to be guidedwholly by the opinion of other people.  I thought our judgments weregiven us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours.  This hasalways been your doctrine, I am sure.""No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection ofthe understanding.  All I have ever attempted to influence has been thebehaviour.  You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general withgreater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt theirsentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?""You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan ofgeneral civility," said Edward to Elinor.  "Do you gain no ground?""Quite the contrary," replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne."My judgment," he returned, "is all on your side of the question; but Iam afraid my practice is much more on your sister's.  I never wish tooffend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when Iam only kept back by my natural awkwardness.  I have frequently thoughtthat I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, Iam so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!""Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers," saidElinor."She knows her own worth too well for false shame," replied Edward."Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way orother.  If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easyand graceful, I should not be shy.""But you would still be reserved," said Marianne, "and that is worse."Edward started--"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?""Yes, very.""I do not understand you," replied he, colouring.  "Reserved!--how, inwhat manner?  What am I to tell you?  What can you suppose?"Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off thesubject, she said to him, "Do not you know my sister well enough tounderstand what she means?  Do not you know she calls every onereserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires asrapturously as herself?"Edward made no answer.  His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on himin their fullest extent--and he sat for some time silent and dull.Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend.  Hisvisit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his ownenjoyment in it appeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he wasunhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguishedher by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt ofinspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed veryuncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradictedone moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morningbefore the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager topromote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them tothemselves.  But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlourdoor open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himselfcome out."I am going into the village to see my horses," said he, "as you arenot yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently."                    ***Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surroundingcountry; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of thevalley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situationthan the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which hadexceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured Marianne'sattention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration ofthese scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that hadparticularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying, "Youmust not enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge in thepicturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of tasteif we come to particulars.  I shall call hills steep, which ought to bebold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular andrugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to beindistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.  You must besatisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give.  I call it avery fine country--the hills are steep, the woods seem full of finetimber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich meadowsand several neat farm houses scattered here and there.  It exactlyanswers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty withutility--and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admireit; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, greymoss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.  I know nothing ofthe picturesque.""I am afraid it is but too true," said Marianne; "but why should youboast of it?""I suspect," said Elinor, "that to avoid one kind of affectation,Edward here falls into another.  Because he believes many peoplepretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they reallyfeel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greaterindifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than hepossesses.  He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.""It is very true," said Marianne, "that admiration of landscape sceneryis become a mere jargon.  Every body pretends to feel and tries todescribe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined whatpicturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes Ihave kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language todescribe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense andmeaning.""I am convinced," said Edward, "that you really feel all the delight ina fine prospect which you profess to feel.  But, in return, your sistermust allow me to feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,but not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked, twisted,blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, andflourishing.  I do not like ruined, tattered cottages.  I am not fondof nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in asnug farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy, happy villagesplease me better than the finest banditti in the world."Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at hersister.  Elinor only laughed.The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remainedthoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plaitof hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers."I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward," she cried.  "Is thatFanny's hair? I remember her promising to give you some.  But I shouldhave thought her hair had been darker."Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--but when she sawhow much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thoughtcould not be surpassed by his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving amomentary glance at Elinor, replied, "Yes; it is my sister's hair.  Thesetting always casts a different shade on it, you know."Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.  That the hairwas her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianneconsidered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must.
