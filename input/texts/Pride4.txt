However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on hisfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the mindsof the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful propertyof some one or other of their daughters."My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard thatNetherfield Park is let at last?"Mr. Bennet replied that he had not."But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and shetold me all about it."Mr. Bennet made no answer."Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently."_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."This was invitation enough."Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is takenby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he camedown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so muchdelighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that heis to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are tobe in the house by the end of next week.""What is his name?""Bingley.""Is he married or single?""Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four orfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!""How so? How can it affect them?""My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! Youmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.""Is that his design in settling here?""Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him assoon as he comes.""I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may sendthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you areas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of theparty.""My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, butI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has fivegrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.""In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.""But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes intothe neighbourhood.""It is more than I engage for, I assure you.""But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it wouldbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined togo, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit nonewcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ tovisit him if you do not.""You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be veryglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of myhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; thoughI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.""I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than theothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half sogood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.""They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they areall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more ofquickness than her sisters.""Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? Youtake delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.""You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. Theyare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with considerationthese last twenty years at least.""Ah, you do not know what I suffer.""But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of fourthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.""It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will notvisit them.""Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit themall."Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years hadbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mindwas less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get herdaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.Chapter 2Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. Hehad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuringhis wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit waspaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the followingmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, hesuddenly addressed her with:"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.""We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes," said her motherresentfully, "since we are not to visit.""But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at theassemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.""I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two niecesof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinionof her.""No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you donot depend on her serving you."Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to containherself, began scolding one of her daughters."Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a littlecompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.""Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she timesthem ill.""I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully. "When isyour next ball to be, Lizzy?""To-morrow fortnight.""Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come backtill the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,for she will not know him herself.""Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduceMr. Bingley to _her_.""Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with himmyself; how can you be so teasing?""I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainlyvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of afortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, asshe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I willtake it on myself."The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense,nonsense!""What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Doyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid onthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and readgreat books and make extracts."Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how."While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.Bingley.""I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife."I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? IfI had known as much this morning I certainly would not have calledon him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, wecannot escape the acquaintance now."The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joywas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all thewhile."How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I shouldpersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well toneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such agood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said aword about it till now.""Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said Mr. Bennet; and,as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife."What an excellent father you have, girls!" said she, when the door wasshut. "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not sopleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; butfor your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the nextball.""Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ theyoungest, I'm the tallest."The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he wouldreturn Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him todinner.Chapter 3Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her fivedaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from herhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked himin various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, anddistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were atlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had beendelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremelyagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assemblywith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond ofdancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very livelyhopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained."If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally wellmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for."In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat aboutten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of beingadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he hadheard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat morefortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upperwindow that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and alreadyhad Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to herhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingleywas obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unableto accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quitedisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in townso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear thathe might be always flying about from one place to another, and neversettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fearsa little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to geta large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingleywas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted theday before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought onlysix with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And whenthe party entered the assembly room it consisted of only fivealtogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, andanother young man.Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasantcountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merelylooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attentionof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, andthe report which was in general circulation within five minutesafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemenpronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared hewas much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with greatadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgustwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to beproud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not allhis large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a mostforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be comparedwith his friend.Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principalpeople in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of givingone himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak forthemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy dancedonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined beingintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening inwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable manin the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike ofhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by hishaving slighted one of her daughters.Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sitdown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had beenstanding near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friendto join it."Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see youstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much betterdance.""I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I amparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as thisit would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is notanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me tostand up with.""I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Mr. Bingley, "for akingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls inmy life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you seeuncommonly pretty.""_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet."Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is oneof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and Idare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.""Which do you mean?" and turning round he looked for a moment atElizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in nohumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slightedby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy hersmiles, for you are wasting your time with me."Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabethremained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfieldparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had beendistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this asher mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane'spleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the mostaccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had beenfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that theyhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in goodspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which theywere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. Witha book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had agood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raisedsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views onthe stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had adifferent story to hear."Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a mostdelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how wellshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced withher twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with hertwice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a secondtime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him standup with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobodycan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was goingdown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, andasked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--""If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more ofhis partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!""Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessivelyhandsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life sawanything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.Hurst's gown--"Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against anydescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branchof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and someexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy."But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by notsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not atall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduringhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so verygreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, mydear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man."Chapter 4When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious inher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how verymuch she admired him."He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible,good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so muchease, with such perfect good breeding!""He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man oughtlikewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.""I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. Idid not expect such a compliment.""Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference betweenus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. Whatcould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not helpseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other womanin the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly isvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many astupider person.""Dear Lizzy!""Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeablein your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in yourlife.""I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speakwhat I think.""I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense ofothers! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with iteverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take thegood of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothingof the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.""Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when youconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keephis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charmingneighbour in her."Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour atthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with morequickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, shewas very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fineladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in thepower of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud andconceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of thefirst private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousandpounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and ofassociating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respectentitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were ofa respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeplyimpressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and theirown had been acquired by trade.Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundredthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase anestate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, andsometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with agood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of thosewho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend theremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation topurchase.His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by nomeans unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who hadmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to considerhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been ofage two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendationto look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it forhalf-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principalrooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took itimmediately.Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite ofgreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by theeasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no dispositioncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own henever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingleyhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no meansdeficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were notinviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingleywas sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continuallygiving offense.The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficientlycharacteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people orprettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentiveto him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon feltacquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could notconceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen acollection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, fornone of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none receivedeither attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,but she smiled too much.Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admiredher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and onewhom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was thereforeestablished as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by suchcommendation to think of her as he chose.Chapter 5Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennetswere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in tradein Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to thehonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him adisgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a houseabout a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to allthe world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render himsupercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. Bynature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.James's had made him courteous.Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be avaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldestof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, wasElizabeth's intimate friend.That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk overa ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assemblybrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate."_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civilself-command to Miss Lucas. "_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice.""Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.""Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To besure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--somethingabout Mr. Robinson.""Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did notI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Merytonassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great manypretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and hisanswering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'""Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem asif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.""_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," saidCharlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.""I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by hisill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quitea misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that hesat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.""Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane."I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.""Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and hecould not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry atbeing spoke to.""Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much,unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkablyagreeable.""I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so veryagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how itwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he hadheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come tothe ball in a hack chaise.""I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but Iwish he had danced with Eliza.""Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,if I were you.""I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.""His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as prideoften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that sovery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_to be proud.""That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.""Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of herreflections, "is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I haveever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that humannature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of uswho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of somequality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are differentthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person maybe proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion ofourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.""If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who came withhis sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack offoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.""Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottledirectly."The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that shewould, and the argument ended only with the visit.Chapter 6The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visitwas soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew onthe goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother wasfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towardsthe two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatestpleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatmentof everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising inall probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. Itwas generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her andto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preferencewhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in away to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that itwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Janeunited, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and auniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicionsof the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas."It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to imposeon the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to beso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skillfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; andit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally inthe dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost everyattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there arevery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love withoutencouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but hemay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.""But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I canperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not todiscover it too.""Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.""But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to concealit, he must find it out.""Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Janemeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as theyalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible thatevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane shouldtherefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command hisattention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure forfalling in love as much as she chooses.""Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is inquestion but the desire of being well married, and if I were determinedto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. Butthese are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of itsreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced fourdances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quiteenough to make her understand his character.""Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she mightonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you mustremember that four evenings have also been spent together--and fourevenings may do a great deal.""Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that theyboth like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any otherleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.""Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; andif she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good achance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for atwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. Ifthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other orever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in theleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards tohave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little aspossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass yourlife.""You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is notsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabethwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of someinterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcelyallowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at theball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But nosooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardlyhad a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendereduncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. Tothis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he haddetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetryin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light andpleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not thoseof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Ofthis she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who madehimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enoughto dance with.He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversingwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing sodrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party wereassembled."What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to myconversation with Colonel Forster?""That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.""But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I seewhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin bybeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to haveany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention sucha subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, sheturned to him and said:"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonlywell just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball atMeryton?""With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a ladyenergetic.""You are severe on us.""It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased," said Miss Lucas. "I am goingto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.""You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting meto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had takena musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I wouldreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit ofhearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,she added, "Very well, if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancingat Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is ofcourse familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and Ishall keep mine to swell my song."Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a songor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several thatshe would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by hersister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one inthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was alwaysimpatient for display.Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given herapplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceitedmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than shehad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to withmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at theend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude byScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly indancing at one end of the room.Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode ofpassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was toomuch engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas washis neighbour, till Sir William thus began:"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! Thereis nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the firstrefinements of polished society.""Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongstthe less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance."Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully," hecontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; "and I doubtnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.""You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.""Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Doyou often dance at St. James's?""Never, sir.""Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?""It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.""You have a house in town, I conclude?"Mr. Darcy bowed."I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fondof superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air ofLondon would agree with Lady Lucas."He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposedto make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he wasstruck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out toher:"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allowme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. Youcannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you."And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, thoughextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantlydrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat younot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour ofher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William atall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion."You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to denyme the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes theamusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige usfor one half-hour.""Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling."He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such apartner?"Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had notinjured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with somecomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:"I can guess the subject of your reverie.""I should imagine not.""You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many eveningsin this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--thenothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What wouldI give to hear your strictures on them!""Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was moreagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasurewhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired hewould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.""Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all astonishment.How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish youjoy?""That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady'simagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from loveto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.""Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter isabsolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you."He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose toentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced herthat all was safe, her wit flowed long.Chapter 7Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of twothousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother'sfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supplythe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, andhad left her four thousand pounds.She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk totheir father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled inLondon in a respectable line of trade.The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a mostconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually temptedthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt andto a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothingbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morninghours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of newsthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn somefrom their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both withnews and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in theneighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was theheadquarters.Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the mostinteresting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledgeof the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long asecret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store offelicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; andMr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animationto their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to theregimentals of an ensign.After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.Bennet coolly observed:"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be twoof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, butI am now convinced."Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfectindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going thenext morning to London."I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be soready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightinglyof anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however.""If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.""Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.""This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. Ihad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I mustso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonlyfoolish.""My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense oftheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they willnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time whenI liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at myheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thoughtColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's inhis regimentals.""Mamma," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and CaptainCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they firstcame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman witha note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waitedfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she waseagerly calling out, while her daughter read,"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.""It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud."MY DEAR FRIEND,--"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without aquarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and thegentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,"CAROLINE BINGLEY""With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of_that_.""Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky.""Can I have the carriage?" said Jane."No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely torain; and then you must stay all night.""That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure thatthey would not offer to send her home.""Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton,and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.""I had much rather go in the coach.""But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They arewanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?""They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.""But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purposewill be answered."She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horseswere engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and hermother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of abad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long beforeit rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother wasdelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;Jane certainly could not come back."This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet more thanonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till thenext morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of hercontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfieldbrought the following note for Elizabeth:"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to beimputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will nothear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having beento me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much thematter with me.--Yours, etc.""Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the notealoud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if sheshould die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit ofMr. Bingley, and under your orders.""Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little triflingcolds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it isall very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage."Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, thoughthe carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walkingwas her only alternative. She declared her resolution."How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such athing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you getthere.""I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.""Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for thehorses?""No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothingwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.""I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but everyimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.""We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia.Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set offtogether."If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we maysee something of Captain Carter before he goes."In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of oneof the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossingfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springingover puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at lastwithin view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a faceglowing with the warmth of exercise.She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane wereassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in suchdirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst andMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contemptfor it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in theirbrother's manners there was something better than politeness; therewas good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of thebrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt asto the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter wasthinking only of his breakfast.Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. MissBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and notwell enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to herimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of givingalarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longedfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left themtogether, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for theextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attendedher.When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabethbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection andsolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and havingexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caughta violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advicewas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her headached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor werethe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, infact, nothing to do elsewhere.When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and veryunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she onlywanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concernin parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offerof the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched toLongbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supplyof clothes.Chapter 8At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past sixElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which thenpoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing themuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a veryfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearingthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, howshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they dislikedbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and theirindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restoredElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she couldregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and hisattentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feelingherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by theothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley wasengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only toeat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plaindish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingleybegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners werepronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought thesame, and added:"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellentwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She reallylooked almost wild.""She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Verynonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about thecountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!""Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deepin mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down tohide it not doing its office.""Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this wasall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkablywell when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quiteescaped my notice.""_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I aminclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make suchan exhibition.""Certainly not.""To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean byit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,a most country-town indifference to decorum.""It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," saidBingley."I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, "thatthis adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.""Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise." Ashort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:"I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a verysweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But withsuch a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there isno chance of it.""I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney inMeryton.""Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.""That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily."If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "itwould not make them one jot less agreeable.""But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of anyconsideration in the world," replied Darcy.To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it theirhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense oftheir dear friend's vulgar relations.With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room onleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, tilllate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, andwhen it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should godownstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the wholeparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspectingthem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister theexcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could staybelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment."Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular.""Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She is a greatreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.""I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.""In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "andI hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well."Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards thetable where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch herothers--all that his library afforded."And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my owncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have morethan I ever looked into."Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with thosein the room."I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have leftso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have atPemberley, Mr. Darcy!""It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of manygenerations.""And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buyingbooks.""I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days asthese.""Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties ofthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may behalf as delightful as Pemberley.""I wish it may.""But I would really advise you to make your purchase in thatneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not afiner county in England than Derbyshire.""With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.""I am talking of possibilities, Charles.""Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to getPemberley by purchase than by imitation."Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her verylittle attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drewnear the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and hiseldest sister, to observe the game."Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "willshe be as tall as I am?""I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, orrather taller.""How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted meso much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplishedfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.""It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patienceto be so very accomplished as they all are.""All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?""Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, andnet purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sureI never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without beinginformed that she was very accomplished.""Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "hastoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it nootherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am veryfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. Icannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of myacquaintance, that are really accomplished.""Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley."Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in youridea of an accomplished woman.""Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.""Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be reallyesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually metwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besidesall this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner ofwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the wordwill be but half-deserved.""All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she mustyet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind byextensive reading.""I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.""Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of allthis?""I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, andapplication, and elegance, as you describe united."Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of herimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women whoanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, withbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As allconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left theroom."Elizabeth Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to theother sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, itsucceeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.""Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,"there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescendto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning isdespicable."Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as tocontinue the subject.Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, andthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent forimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice couldbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the mosteminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not sounwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settledthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennetwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sistersdeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better reliefto his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that everyattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.Chapter 9Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in themorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to theinquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on hissisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have anote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form herown judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, andits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by hertwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have beenvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness wasnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as herrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. Shewould not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carriedhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, thinkit at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on MissBingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters allattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopesthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected."Indeed I have, sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal too ill to bemoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespassa little longer on your kindness.""Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I amsure, will not hear of her removal.""You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while sheremains with us."Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments."I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do notknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffersa vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which isalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetesttemper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they arenothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and acharming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in thecountry that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting itin a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.""Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if Ishould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in fiveminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.""That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth."You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her."Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.""I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seenthrough I am afraid is pitiful.""That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricatecharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.""Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on inthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.""I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were astudier of character. It must be an amusing study.""Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have atleast that advantage.""The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but a few subjects forsuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined andunvarying society.""But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to beobserved in them for ever.""Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioninga country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as much of _that_going on in the country as in town."Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a completevictory over him, continued her triumph."I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, formy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast dealpleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?""When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it;and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each theiradvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.""Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But thatgentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothingat all.""Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for hermother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was notsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,which you must acknowledge to be true.""Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meetingwith many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are fewneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families."Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep hiscountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towardsMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake ofsaying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her ifCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away."Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man SirWilliam is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! Sogenteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves veryimportant, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.""Did Charlotte dine with you?""No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. Formy part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is tojudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I thinkCharlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.""She seems a very pleasant young woman.""Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herselfhas often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boastof my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybodybetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my ownpartiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brotherGardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law wassure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, hedid not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verseson her, and very pretty they were.""And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There hasbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who firstdiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!""I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy."Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what isstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, Iam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabethtremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed tospeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness toJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley wasunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to becivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her partindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, andsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest ofher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering toeach other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that theyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first cominginto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexionand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whoseaffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had highanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which theattention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her owneasy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was veryequal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, andabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the mostshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to thissudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and whenyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day ofthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill."Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yes--it would be much better towait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carterwould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball," sheadded, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell ColonelForster it will be quite a shame if he does not."Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returnedinstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to theremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite ofall Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.Chapter 10The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and MissBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, whocontinued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joinedtheir party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watchingthe progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention bymessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, andMrs. Hurst was observing their game.Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused inattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetualcommendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evennessof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcernwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and wasexactly in union with her opinion of each."How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"He made no answer."You write uncommonly fast.""You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.""How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of ayear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!""It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.""Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.""I have already told her so once, by your desire.""I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mendpens remarkably well.""Thank you--but I always mend my own.""How can you contrive to write so even?"He was silent."Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautifullittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to MissGrantley's.""Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? Atpresent I have not room to do them justice.""Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do youalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?""They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for meto determine.""It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter withease, cannot write ill.""That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried herbrother, "because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much forwords of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?""My style of writing is very different from yours.""Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless wayimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.""My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by whichmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.""Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof.""Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance ofhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes anindirect boast.""And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?""The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects inwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity ofthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, youthink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything withquickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without anyattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfieldyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort ofpanegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so verylaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary businessundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?""Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all thefoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at thismoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needlessprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.""I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced thatyou would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite asdependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you weremounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had betterstay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably notgo--and at another word, might stay a month.""You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley didnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now muchmore than he did himself.""I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what myfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I amafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no meansintend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such acircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as Icould.""Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentionsas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?""Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak forhimself.""You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, tostand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, andthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offeringone argument in favour of its propriety.""To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no meritwith you.""To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding ofeither.""You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence offriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often makeone readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reasonone into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you havesupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till thecircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviourthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of novery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complyingwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?""Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, toarrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is toappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsistingbetween the parties?""By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, notforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have moreweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assureyou, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison withmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do notknow a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and inparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,when he has nothing to do."Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he wasrather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmlyresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with herbrother for talking such nonsense."I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. "You dislike an argument,and want to silence this.""Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and MissBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be verythankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.""What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.Darcy had much better finish his letter."Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabethfor an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrityto the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would leadthe way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, sheseated herself.Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-booksthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixedon her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object ofadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at herbecause he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,however, at last that she drew his notice because there was somethingmore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than inany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She likedhim too little to care for his approbation.After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm bya lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing nearElizabeth, said to her:"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such anopportunity of dancing a reel?"She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with somesurprise at her silence."Oh!" said she, "I heard you before, but I could not immediatelydetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I alwaysdelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person oftheir premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tellyou, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me ifyou dare.""Indeed I do not dare."Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at hisgallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in hermanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcyhad never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He reallybelieved, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, heshould be in some danger.Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her greatanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received someassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking oftheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance."I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubberythe next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when thisdesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running afterofficers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour tocheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,which your lady possesses.""Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?""Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placedin the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle thejudge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in differentlines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, forwhat painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?""It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but theircolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might becopied."At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst andElizabeth herself."I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in someconfusion, lest they had been overheard."You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "running away withouttelling us that you were coming out."Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walkby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,and immediately said:"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into theavenue."But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,laughingly answered:"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appearto uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting afourth. Good-bye."She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope ofbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recoveredas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.Chapter 11When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to hersister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into thedrawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with manyprofessions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeableas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe anentertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laughat their acquaintance with spirit.But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she hadsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressedhimself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst alsomade her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffusenessand warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy andattention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest sheshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desireto the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further fromthe door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyoneelse. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with greatdelight.When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of thecard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his openpetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, andthe silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of thesofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her braceletsand rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with MissBennet.Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and shewas perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. Shecould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered herquestion, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to beamused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was thesecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasantit is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is noenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of abook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have notan excellent library."No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, andcast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearingher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenlytowards him and said:"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance atNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consultthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there arenot some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than apleasure.""If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if hechooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settledthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall sendround my cards.""I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they werecarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferablytedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be muchmore rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order ofthe day.""Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not benear so much like a ball."Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walkedabout the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; butDarcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. Inthe desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,turning to Elizabeth, said:"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take aturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting solong in one attitude."Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingleysucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy lookedup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter asElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He wasdirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing thathe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and downthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them wouldinterfere. "What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be hismeaning?"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severeon us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothingabout it."Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy inanything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of histwo motives."I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soonas she allowed him to speak. "You either choose this method of passingthe evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secretaffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figuresappear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would becompletely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much betteras I sit by the fire.""Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard anything soabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?""Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. "Wecan all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimateas you are, you must know how it is to be done.""But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy hasnot yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence ofmind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we willnot expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without asubject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.""Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That is anuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it wouldbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love alaugh.""Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me more credit than can be.The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of theiractions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object inlife is a joke.""Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope Iam not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are preciselywhat you are without.""Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the studyof my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strongunderstanding to ridicule.""Such as vanity and pride.""Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a realsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile."Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley;"and pray what is the result?""I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns ithimself without disguise.""No," said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouchfor. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for theconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of othersso soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelingsare not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temperwould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lostforever.""_That_ is a failing indeed!" cried Elizabeth. "Implacable resentment_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. Ireally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.""There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particularevil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.""And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.""And yours," he replied with a smile, "is willfully to misunderstandthem.""Do let us have a little music," cried Miss Bingley, tired of aconversation in which she had no share. "Louisa, you will not mind mywaking Mr. Hurst?"Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte wasopened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry forit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.Chapter 12In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote thenext morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent forthem in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated onher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, whichwould exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receivethem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, atleast not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriagebefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingleyand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare themvery well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positivelyresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on thecontrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and atlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfieldthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough wassaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to workon Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley wasthen sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislikeof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go sosoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not besafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm whereshe felt herself to be right.To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been atNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and MissBingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admirationshould _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hopeof influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had beensuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weightin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoketen words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they wereat one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered mostconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almostall, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at lastvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give herto see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her mosttenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave ofthe whole party in the liveliest of spirits.They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennetwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so muchtrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But theirfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was reallyglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. Theevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much ofits animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane andElizabeth.They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and humannature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations ofthreadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had informationfor them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been saidin the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officershad dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and ithad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.Chapter 13"I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were atbreakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.""Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinnersare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.""The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger."Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. "A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to begot to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill thismoment.""It is _not_ Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom Inever saw in the whole course of my life."This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of beingeagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight agoI answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiringearly attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.""Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thingin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your ownchildren; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long agoto do something or other about it."Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. Theyhad often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on whichMrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to railbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family offive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about."It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "andnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a littlesoftened by his manner of expressing himself.""No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent ofhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such falsefriends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father didbefore him?""Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on thathead, as you will hear.""Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October."Dear Sir,--"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honouredfather always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had themisfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; butfor some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it mightseem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyonewith whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There, Mrs.Bennet.'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for havingreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to bedistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine deBourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence haspreferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall bemy earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards herladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies whichare instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, Ifeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace inall families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds Iflatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, andthat the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estatewill be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject theoffered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being themeans of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise forit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possibleamends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection toreceive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waitingon you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, andshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennightfollowing, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherineis far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, providedthat some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--Iremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady anddaughters, your well-wisher and friend,"WILLIAM COLLINS""At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a mostconscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not willprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be soindulgent as to let him come to us again.""There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and ifhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person todiscourage him.""Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can meanto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to hiscredit."Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for LadyCatherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and buryinghis parishioners whenever it were required."He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make himout.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can hemean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose hewould help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?""No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite thereverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in hisletter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.""In point of composition," said Mary, "the letter does not seemdefective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet Ithink it is well expressed."To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in anydegree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin shouldcome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they hadreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As fortheir mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure whichastonished her husband and daughters.Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with greatpoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but theladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither inneed of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was atall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave andstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seatedbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family ofdaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in thisinstance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he didnot doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. Thisgallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily."You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it mayprove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled sooddly.""You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.""Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, youmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such thingsI know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estateswill go when once they come to be entailed.""I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, andcould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearingforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I comeprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,when we are better acquainted--"He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on eachother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. Thehall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet'sheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as hisown future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; andhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of itscooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, whoassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep agood cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. Hebegged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declaredherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about aquarter of an hour.Chapter 14During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servantswere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with hisguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him toshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. LadyCatherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration forhis comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosenbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated himto more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspecthe protested that "he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour ina person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himselfexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased toapprove of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour ofpreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool ofquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by manypeople he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; shemade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of theneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week ortwo, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him tomarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and hadonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectlyapproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafedto suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.""That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "andI dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladiesin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?""The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lanefrom Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.""I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?""She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of veryextensive property.""Ah!" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off thanmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?""She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself saysthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to thehandsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marksthe young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sicklyconstitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in manyaccomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I aminformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who stillresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescendsto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.""Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies atcourt.""Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived theBritish court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleasedwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion tooffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptableto ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, thather charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the mostelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned byher. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, andit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound topay.""You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for youthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I askwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of themoment, or are the result of previous study?""They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though Isometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegantcompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish togive them as unstudied an air as possible."Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurdas he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partnerin his pleasure.By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was gladto take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readilyassented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everythingannounced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, andbegging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared athim, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after somedeliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened thevolume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read threepages, she interrupted him with:"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning awayRichard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told meso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear moreabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by booksof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazesme, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous tothem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist atbackgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he actedvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia'sinterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he wouldresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore hisyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as anyaffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and preparedfor backgammon.Chapter 15Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature hadbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest partof his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate andmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, hehad merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any usefulacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up hadgiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now agood deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living inretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpectedprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine deBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect whichhe felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as aclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture ofpride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended tomarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he hada wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he foundthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father'sestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility andsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his ownpart.His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely faceconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of whatwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settledchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in aquarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, aconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturallyto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it atLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and generalencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. "As toher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she couldnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on herto hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soondone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equallynext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon havetwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak ofthe day before was now high in her good graces.Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sisterexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followedhim after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged withone of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Suchdoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had beenalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he toldElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of thehouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in theirwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walkerthan a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of hiscousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention ofthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes wereimmediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, andnothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin ina shop window, could recall them.But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whomthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walkingwith another officer on the other side of the way. The officer wasthe very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia cameto inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with thestranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, underpretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunatelyhad just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, hadreached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreatedpermission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned withhim the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted acommission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for theyoung man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part ofbeauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readinessof conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct andunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking togethervery agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcyand Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing theladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, andbegan the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, andMiss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way toLongbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroboratedit with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyeson Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of thestranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as theylooked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy justdeigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible toimagine; it was impossible not to long to know.In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed whatpassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door ofMr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia'spressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite ofMrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding theinvitation.Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she waseagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, astheir own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothingabout, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in thestreet, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts toNetherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civilitywas claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. Shereceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned withas much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previousacquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies whointroduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such anexcess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soonput to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, thatMr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have alieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him thelast hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued theoccupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of theofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Phillipsesthe next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbournwould come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillipsprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lotterytickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of suchdelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assuredwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen passbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended eitheror both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explainsuch behaviour than her sister.Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiringMrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except LadyCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but evenpointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, althoughutterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might beattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with somuch attention in the whole course of his life.Chapter 16As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with theiraunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet fora single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coachconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; andthe girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then inthe house.When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so muchstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared hemight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfastparlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey muchgratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him whatRosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to thedescription of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and foundthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt allthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparisonwith the housekeeper's room.In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, andthe improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until thegentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentivelistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what sheheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours assoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examinetheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, theinterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinkingof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; butMr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, andwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye wasturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seatedhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell intoconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feelthat the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be renderedinteresting by the skill of the speaker.With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and theofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the youngladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kindlistener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantlysupplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, hehad the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist."I know little of the game at present," said he, "but I shall be gladto improve myself, for in my situation in life--" Mrs. Phillips was veryglad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was hereceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first thereseemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a mostdetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making betsand exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was thereforeat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hearhim, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to betold--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared noteven mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedlyrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how farNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked ina hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there."About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subjectdrop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, Iunderstand.""Yes," replied Mr. Wickham; "his estate there is a noble one. A clearten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person morecapable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, forI have been connected with his family in a particular manner from myinfancy."Elizabeth could not but look surprised."You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, afterseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meetingyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?""As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth very warmly. "I havespent four days in the same house with him, and I think him verydisagreeable.""I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his beingagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known himtoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in generalastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so stronglyanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.""Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house inthe neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked inHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not findhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.""I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a shortinterruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyondtheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. Theworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by hishigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.""I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be anill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head."I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he islikely to be in this country much longer.""I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when Iwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire willnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.""Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason foravoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a senseof very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what heis. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best menthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can neverbe in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul bya thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has beenscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything andeverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing thememory of his father."Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened withall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, theneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all thathe had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but veryintelligible gallantry."It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to bea most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted mefurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very greatattentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, andmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances havenow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--Iwas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been inpossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman wewere speaking of just now.""Indeed!""Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the bestliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was givenelsewhere.""Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be? How could hiswill be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?""There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as togive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted theintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merelyconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claimto it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certainit is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I wasof an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and noless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really doneanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, andI may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I canrecall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sortof men, and that he hates me.""This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.""Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till Ican forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer thanever as he expressed them."But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive? What canhave induced him to behave so cruelly?""A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot butattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked meless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommonattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He hadnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sortof preference which was often given me.""I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never likedhim. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to bedespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him ofdescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity asthis."After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability ofhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His dispositionmust be dreadful.""I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham; "I can hardlybe just to him."Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "Totreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of hisfather!" She could have added, "A young man, too, like _you_, whose verycountenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herselfwith, "and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!""We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatestpart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be ofuse to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of thePemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a mostintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself tobe under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him avoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it tobe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.""How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable! I wonder that the verypride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no bettermotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--fordishonesty I must call it.""It _is_ wonderful," replied Wickham, "for almost all his actions maybe traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It hasconnected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we arenone of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were strongerimpulses even than pride.""Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?""Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his moneyfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve thepoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of whathis father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of thePemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind andcareful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried upas the most attentive and best of brothers.""What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?"He shook his head. "I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain tospeak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, veryproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fondof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she isnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, herhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends hereducation."After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could nothelp reverting once more to the first, and saying:"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do youknow Mr. Bingley?""Not at all.""He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.Darcy is.""Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does notwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worthhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he isa very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. Hispride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing somethingfor fortune and figure."The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered roundthe other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousinElizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success weremade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost everypoint; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the leastimportance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and beggedthat she would not make herself uneasy."I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to acard-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily Iam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. Thereare undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to LadyCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regardinglittle matters."Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins fora few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relationwas very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh."Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given hima living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to hernotice, but he certainly has not known her long.""You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcywere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.""No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine'sconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day beforeyesterday.""Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it isbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor MissBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless heraffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were alreadyself-destined for another."Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and herdaughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being hispatroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.""I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I havenot seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never likedher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has thereputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believeshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part fromher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for hernephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have anunderstanding of the first class."Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, andthey continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supperput an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noiseof Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him toeverybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, donegracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She couldthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, allthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his nameas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydiatalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and thefish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. andMrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his lossesat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearingthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well managebefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.Chapter 17Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; sheknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question theveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. Thepossibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough tointerest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to bedone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not beotherwise explained."They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some wayor other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhapsmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us toconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,without actual blame on either side.""Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say onbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in thebusiness? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill ofsomebody.""Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of myopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful lightit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in sucha manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It isimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for hischaracter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be soexcessively deceived in him? Oh! no.""I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, thanthat Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave melast night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If itbe not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in hislooks.""It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what tothink.""I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think."But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affairbecame public.The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where thisconversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they hadbeen speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personalinvitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixedfor the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see theirdear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedlyasked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. Tothe rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennetas much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all tothe others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with anactivity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as ifeager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to everyfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given incompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flatteredby receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of aceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in thesociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; andElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's lookand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia dependedless on any single event, or any particular person, for though theyeach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ballwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that shehad no disinclination for it."While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough--Ithink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of thosewho consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable foreverybody."Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she didnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help askinghim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and ifhe did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening'samusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained noscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebukeeither from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing todance."I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ballof this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancingmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my faircousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity ofsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the rightcause, and not to any disrespect for her."Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed beingengaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collinsinstead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no helpfor it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforcedelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with asgood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with hisgallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now firststruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthyof being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form aquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasingcivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at acompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished thangratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long beforeher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriagewas extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not chooseto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be theconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, andtill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, theyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at thistime, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, therewas such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Merytononce. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the veryshoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might havefound some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended theimprovement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less thana dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, andMonday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.Chapter 18Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked invain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, adoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certaintyof meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections thatmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more thanusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of allthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more thanmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arosethe dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy'spleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and thoughthis was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence waspronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and whotold them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business theday before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, ifhe had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here."This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught byElizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable forWickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, everyfeeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediatedisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility tothe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. Shewas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned awaywith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even inspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospectof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on herspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she hadnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transitionto the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particularnotice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without beingaware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeablepartner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release fromhim was ecstasy.She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking ofWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those danceswere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation withher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who tookher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away againimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence ofmind; Charlotte tried to console her:"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.""Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To finda man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such anevil."When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim herhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be asimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasantin the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made noanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to whichshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, andreading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholdingit. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began toimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and atfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it wouldbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she madesome slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was againsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second timewith:--"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talkedabout the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the sizeof the room, or the number of couples."He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should besaid."Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I mayobserve that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But_now_ we may be silent.""Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?""Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to beentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have thetrouble of saying as little as possible.""Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do youimagine that you are gratifying mine?""Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a greatsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to saysomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down toposterity with all the eclat of a proverb.""This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"said he. "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.""I must not decide on my own performance."He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone downthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very oftenwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resistthe temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had justbeen forming a new acquaintance."The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread hisfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herselffor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in aconstrained manner said, "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy mannersas may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of_retaining_ them, is less certain.""He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabethwith emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from allhis life."Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. Atthat moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to passthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him onhis dancing and his partner."I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such verysuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to thefirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does notdisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing ather sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will thenflow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. Youwill not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of thatyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but SirWilliam's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and hiseyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley andJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,he turned to his partner, and said, "Sir William's interruption has mademe forget what we were talking of.""I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not haveinterrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what weare to talk of next I cannot imagine.""What think you of books?" said he, smiling."Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the samefeelings.""I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least beno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.""No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full ofsomething else.""The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he,with a look of doubt."Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for herthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appearedby her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created wasunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _beingcreated_.""I am," said he, with a firm voice."And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?""I hope not.""It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,to be secure of judging properly at first.""May I ask to what these questions tend?""Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouringto shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it out.""And what is your success?"She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such differentaccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.""I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that reports may varygreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you werenot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason tofear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.""But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have anotheropportunity.""I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted insilence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towardsher, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger againstanother.They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, andwith an expression of civil disdain accosted her:"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousandquestions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, amonghis other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the lateMr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not togive implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy'susing him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he hasalways been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treatedMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, butI know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that hecannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brotherthought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation tothe officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himselfout of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolentthing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,considering his descent, one could not expect much better.""His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," saidElizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worsethan of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I canassure you, he informed me himself.""I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer."Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.""Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much mistakenif you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I seenothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to makeinquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile ofsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficientlymarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude forWickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave waybefore the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness."I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than hersister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you havebeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which caseyou may be sure of my pardon.""No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothingsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole ofhis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which haveprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced thatMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he hasreceived; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he hasbeen very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.""Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?""No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.""This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I amsatisfied. But what does he say of the living?""He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heardthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left tohim _conditionally_ only.""I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly;"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; butsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learntthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think ofboth gentlemen as I did before."She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and onwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened withdelight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidencein it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrewto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her lastpartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate asto make a most important discovery."I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is nowin the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear thegentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours ofthe house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother LadyCatherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would havethought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine deBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is madein time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going todo, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My totalignorance of the connection must plead my apology.""You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!""Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power toassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight."Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring himthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introductionas an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; thatit was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on eitherside; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior inconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to herwith the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she.
