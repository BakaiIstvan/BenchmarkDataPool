The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.  Their estatewas large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre oftheir property, where, for many generations, they had lived in sorespectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of theirsurrounding acquaintance.  The late owner of this estate was a singleman, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of hislife, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.  But herdeath, which happened ten years before his own, produced a greatalteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and receivedinto his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legalinheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended tobequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece, and theirchildren, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent.  Hisattachment to them all increased.  The constant attention of Mr. andMrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely frominterest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solidcomfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of thechildren added a relish to his existence.By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his presentlady, three daughters.  The son, a steady respectable young man, wasamply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.  By his ownmarriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to hiswealth.  To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was notso really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independentof what might arise to them from their father's inheriting thatproperty, could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and theirfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for theremaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to herchild, and he had only a life-interest in it.The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every otherwill, gave as much disappointment as pleasure.  He was neither sounjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;--buthe left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of thebequest.  Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wifeand daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son, and hisson's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, asto leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dearto him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, orby any sale of its valuable woods.  The whole was tied up for thebenefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father andmother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, bysuch attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or threeyears old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having hisown way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweighall the value of all the attention which, for years, he had receivedfrom his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to be unkind, however,and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them athousand pounds a-piece.Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper wascheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years,and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produceof an estate already large, and capable of almost immediateimprovement.  But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, washis only one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer; and tenthousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained forhis widow and daughters.His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illnesscould command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of thefamily; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature atsuch a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to makethem comfortable.  His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there mightprudently be in his power to do for them.He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold heartedand rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, wellrespected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge ofhis ordinary duties.  Had he married a more amiable woman, he mighthave been made still more respectable than he was:--he might even havebeen made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, andvery fond of his wife.  But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricatureof himself;--more narrow-minded and selfish.When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself toincrease the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousandpounds a-piece.  He then really thought himself equal to it.  Theprospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed hisheart, and made him feel capable of generosity.-- "Yes, he would givethem three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It wouldbe enough to make them completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! hecould spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience."-- Hethought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he didnot repent.No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,arrived with her child and their attendants.  No one could dispute herright to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of hisfather's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much thegreater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only commonfeelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--but in HER mind there wasa sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence ofthe kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source ofimmovable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite withany of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till thepresent, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort ofother people she could act when occasion required it.So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and soearnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on thearrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, hadnot the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on thepropriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three childrendetermined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breachwith their brother.Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possesseda strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualifiedher, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, andenabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have ledto imprudence.  She had an excellent heart;--her disposition wasaffectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to governthem: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and whichone of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's.She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, herjoys, could have no moderation.  She was generous, amiable,interesting: she was everything but prudent.  The resemblance betweenher and her mother was strikingly great.Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; butby Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished.  They encouraged eachother now in the violence of their affliction.  The agony of griefwhich overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was soughtfor, was created again and again.  They gave themselves up wholly totheir sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection thatcould afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation infuture.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she couldstruggle, she could exert herself.  She could consult with her brother,could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her withproper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similarexertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; butas she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance, withouthaving much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equalher sisters at a more advanced period of life.Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and hermother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and byher husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybodybeyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really pressed them,with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as noplan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till shecould accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, hisinvitation was accepted.A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of formerdelight, was exactly what suited her mind.  In seasons of cheerfulness,no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greaterdegree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happinessitself.  But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intendedto do for his sisters.  To take three thousand pounds from the fortuneof their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the mostdreadful degree.  She begged him to think again on the subject.  Howcould he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too,of so large a sum?  And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as norelationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount.  Itwas very well known that no affection was ever supposed to existbetween the children of any man by different marriages; and why was heto ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all hismoney to his half sisters?"It was my father's last request to me," replied her husband, "that Ishould assist his widow and daughters.""He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but hewas light-headed at the time.  Had he been in his right senses, hecould not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away halfyour fortune from your own child.""He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he onlyrequested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make theirsituation more comfortable than it was in his power to do.  Perhaps itwould have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.  He couldhardly suppose I should neglect them.  But as he required the promise,I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.  Somethingmust be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a newhome.""Well, then, LET something be done for them; but THAT something neednot be three thousand pounds.  Consider," she added, "that when themoney is once parted with, it never can return.  Your sisters willmarry, and it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could be restoredto our poor little boy--""Why, to be sure," said her husband, very gravely, "that would makegreat difference.  The time may come when Harry will regret that solarge a sum was parted with.  If he should have a numerous family, forinstance, it would be a very convenient addition.""To be sure it would.""Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum werediminished one half.--Five hundred pounds would be a prodigiousincrease to their fortunes!""Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth would do half somuch for his sisters, even if REALLY his sisters!  And as it is--onlyhalf blood!--But you have such a generous spirit!""I would not wish to do any thing mean," he replied.  "One had rather,on such occasions, do too much than too little.  No one, at least, canthink I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardlyexpect more.""There is no knowing what THEY may expect," said the lady, "but we arenot to think of their expectations: the question is, what you canafford to do.""Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five hundred poundsa-piece.  As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each haveabout three thousand pounds on their mother's death--a very comfortablefortune for any young woman.""To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want noaddition at all.  They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongstthem.  If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they donot, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of tenthousand pounds.""That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon thewhole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their motherwhile she lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind Imean.--My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable."His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to thisplan."To be sure," said she, "it is better than parting with fifteen hundredpounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen yearswe shall be completely taken in.""Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half thatpurchase.""Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever whenthere is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy,and hardly forty.  An annuity is a very serious business; it comes overand over every year, and there is no getting rid of it.  You are notaware of what you are doing.  I have known a great deal of the troubleof annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three toold superannuated servants by my father's will, and it is amazing howdisagreeable she found it.  Twice every year these annuities were to bepaid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and thenone of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to beno such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.  Her income was not herown, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the moreunkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have beenentirely at my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever.  Ithas given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I wouldnot pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.""It is certainly an unpleasant thing," replied Mr. Dashwood, "to havethose kind of yearly drains on one's income.  One's fortune, as yourmother justly says, is NOT one's own.  To be tied down to the regularpayment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: ittakes away one's independence.""Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.  They thinkthemselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raisesno gratitude at all.  If I were you, whatever I did should be done atmy own discretion entirely.  I would not bind myself to allow them anything yearly.  It may be very inconvenient some years to spare ahundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.""I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there shouldbe no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally willbe of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because theywould only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a largerincome, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of theyear.  It will certainly be much the best way.  A present of fiftypounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed formoney, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father.""To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced withinmyself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money atall.  The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as mightbe reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for acomfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever theyare in season.  I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.  Do but consider,my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-lawand her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, whichbrings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they willpay their mother for their board out of it.  Altogether, they will havefive hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women wantfor more than that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping willbe nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardlyany servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses ofany kind!  Only conceive how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred ayear! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and asto your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it.  They willbe much more able to give YOU something.""Upon my word," said Mr. Dashwood, "I believe you are perfectly right.My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me thanwhat you say.  I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfilmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as youhave described.  When my mother removes into another house my servicesshall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some littlepresent of furniture too may be acceptable then.""Certainly," returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  "But, however, ONE thingmust be considered.  When your father and mother moved to Norland,though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, andlinen was saved, and is now left to your mother.  Her house willtherefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.""That is a material consideration undoubtedly.  A valuable legacyindeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasantaddition to our own stock here.""Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as whatbelongs to this house.  A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, forany place THEY can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this: that you owe noparticular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we verywell know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in theworld to THEM."This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his intentions whatever ofdecision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would beabsolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for thewidow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts ashis own wife pointed out.Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from anydisinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceasedto raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for whenher spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some otherexertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholyremembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in herinquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; forto remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.  But she couldhear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort andease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadierjudgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, whichher mother would have approved.Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise onthe part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his lastearthly reflections.  She doubted the sincerity of this assurance nomore than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for herdaughters' sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she waspersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her inaffluence.  For their brother's sake, too, for the sake of his ownheart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to hismerit before, in believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentivebehaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfarewas dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on theliberality of his intentions.The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt forher daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledgeof her character, which half a year's residence in her family afforded;and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternalaffection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found itimpossible to have lived together so long, had not a particularcircumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according tothe opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland.This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl andthe brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing youngman, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister'sestablishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part ofhis time there.Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives ofinterest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had diedvery rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on thewill of his mother.  But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by eitherconsideration.  It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortuneshould keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance ofdisposition; and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged byevery one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by anypeculiar graces of person or address.  He was not handsome, and hismanners required intimacy to make them pleasing.  He was too diffidentto do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.His understanding was good, and his education had given it solidimprovement.  But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition toanswer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see himdistinguished--as--they hardly knew what.  They wanted him to make afine figure in the world in some manner or other.  His mother wished tointerest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or tosee him connected with some of the great men of the day.  Mrs. JohnDashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of thesesuperior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted herambition to see him driving a barouche.  But Edward had no turn forgreat men or barouches.  All his wishes centered in domestic comfortand the quiet of private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brotherwho was more promising.Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engagedmuch of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she was, at that time, in suchaffliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects.  She sawonly that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.  Hedid not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation.She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by areflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the differencebetween him and his sister.  It was a contrast which recommended himmost forcibly to her mother."It is enough," said she; "to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough.It implies everything amiable.  I love him already.""I think you will like him," said Elinor, "when you know more of him.""Like him!" replied her mother with a smile.  "I feel no sentiment ofapprobation inferior to love.""You may esteem him.""I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love."Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.  Her mannerswere attaching, and soon banished his reserve.  She speedilycomprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinorperhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of hisworth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against allher established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be, was nolonger uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temperaffectionate.No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour toElinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, andlooked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching."In a few months, my dear Marianne." said she, "Elinor will, in allprobability be settled for life.  We shall miss her; but SHE will behappy.""Oh! Mama, how shall we do without her?""My love, it will be scarcely a separation.  We shall live within a fewmiles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives.  You willgain a brother, a real, affectionate brother.  I have the highestopinion in the world of Edward's heart.  But you look grave, Marianne;do you disapprove your sister's choice?""Perhaps," said Marianne, "I may consider it with some surprise.Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly.  But yet--he is notthe kind of young man--there is something wanting--his figure is notstriking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the manwho could seriously attach my sister.  His eyes want all that spirit,that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence.  And besidesall this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no real taste.  Music seemsscarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's drawings verymuch, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand theirworth.  It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her whileshe draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires asa lover, not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters must beunited.  I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in everypoint coincide with my own.  He must enter into all my feelings; thesame books, the same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, howspiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!I felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it with so muchcomposure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.  I could hardly keep myseat.  To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almostdriven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, suchdreadful indifference!""He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose.I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give him Cowper.""Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--but we must allowfor difference of taste.  Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore shemay overlook it, and be happy with him.  But it would have broke MYheart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that Ishall never see a man whom I can really love.  I require so much!  Hemust have all Edward's virtues, and his person and manners mustornament his goodness with every possible charm.""Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.  It is yet too early inlife to despair of such a happiness.  Why should you be less fortunatethan your mother?  In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may yourdestiny be different from hers!""What a pity it is, Elinor," said Marianne, "that Edward should have notaste for drawing.""No taste for drawing!" replied Elinor, "why should you think so? Hedoes not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing theperformances of other people, and I assure you he is by no meansdeficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities ofimproving it.  Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think hewould have drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment in suchmatters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on anypicture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, whichin general direct him perfectly right."Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; butthe kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by thedrawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, thoughsmiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for thatblind partiality to Edward which produced it."I hope, Marianne," continued Elinor, "you do not consider him asdeficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were youropinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him."Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She would not wound the feelings ofher sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe wasimpossible.  At length she replied:"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thingequal to your sense of his merits.  I have not had so manyopportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, hisinclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion inthe world of his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that isworthy and amiable.""I am sure," replied Elinor, with a smile, "that his dearest friendscould not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that.  I do notperceive how you could express yourself more warmly."Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased."Of his sense and his goodness," continued Elinor, "no one can, Ithink, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him inunreserved conversation.  The excellence of his understanding and hisprinciples can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keepshim silent.  You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have frompeculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and Ihave been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have beenwholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother.  Ihave seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heardhis opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, Iventure to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of booksexceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just andcorrect, and his taste delicate and pure.  His abilities in everyrespect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his personcan hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, whichare uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, isperceived.  At present, I know him so well, that I think him reallyhandsome; or at least, almost so.  What say you, Marianne?""I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now.  Whenyou tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfectionin his face, than I now do in his heart."Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth shehad been betrayed into, in speaking of him.  She felt that Edward stoodvery high in her opinion.  She believed the regard to be mutual; butshe required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction oftheir attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that what Marianne and hermother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them,to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect.  She tried to explainthe real state of the case to her sister."I do not attempt to deny," said she, "that I think very highly ofhim--that I greatly esteem, that I like him."Marianne here burst forth with indignation--"Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!  worse thancold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.  Use those words again, and Iwill leave the room this moment."Elinor could not help laughing.  "Excuse me," said she; "and be assuredthat I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of myown feelings.  Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion--thehope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly.But farther than this you must not believe.  I am by no means assuredof his regard for me.  There are moments when the extent of it seemsdoubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder atmy wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, bybelieving or calling it more than it is.  In my heart I feellittle--scarcely any doubt of his preference.  But there are otherpoints to be considered besides his inclination.  He is very far frombeing independent.  What his mother really is we cannot know; but, fromFanny's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have neverbeen disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken ifEdward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties inhis way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a greatfortune or high rank."Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her motherand herself had outstripped the truth."And you really are not engaged to him!" said she.  "Yet it certainlysoon will happen.  But two advantages will proceed from this delay.  Ishall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity ofimproving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must beso indispensably necessary to your future felicity.  Oh! if he shouldbe so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, howdelightful it would be!"Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.  She could notconsider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Mariannehad believed it.  There was, at times, a want of spirits about himwhich, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost asunpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need notgive him more than inquietude.  It would not be likely to produce thatdejection of mind which frequently attended him.  A more reasonablecause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade theindulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother neither behavedto him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give himany assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictlyattending to her views for his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledgeas this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.  Shewas far from depending on that result of his preference of her, whichher mother and sister still considered as certain.  Nay, the longerthey were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard;and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no morethan friendship.But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceivedby his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which wasstill more common,) to make her uncivil.  She took the firstopportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking toher so expressively of her brother's great expectations, of Mrs.Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of thedanger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; thatMrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor tobe calm.  She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, andinstantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be theinconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinorshould not be exposed another week to such insinuations.In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from thepost, which contained a proposal particularly well timed.  It was theoffer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation ofher own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.  Theletter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spiritof friendly accommodation.  He understood that she was in need of adwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,he assured her that everything should be done to it which she mightthink necessary, if the situation pleased her.  He earnestly pressedher, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come withher daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, fromwhence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houseswere in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortableto her.  He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole ofhis letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail ofgiving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she wassuffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearerconnections.  She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry.  Herresolution was formed as she read.  The situation of Barton, in acounty so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hoursbefore, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh everypossible advantage belonging to the place, was now its firstrecommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer anevil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison ofthe misery of continuing her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove forever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit orvisit it while such a woman was its mistress.  She instantly wrote SirJohn Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptanceof his proposal; and then hastened to shew both letters to herdaughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before heranswer were sent.Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settleat some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their presentacquaintance.  On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to opposeher mother's intention of removing into Devonshire.  The house, too, asdescribed by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent souncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on eitherpoint; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charmto her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norlandbeyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother fromsending a letter of acquiescence.No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herselfin the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that shewas provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer than tillevery thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They heard her withsurprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly hopedthat she would not be settled far from Norland. She had greatsatisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edwardturned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of surpriseand concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated,"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And towhat part of it?" She explained the situation. It was within four milesnorthward of Exeter."It is but a cottage," she continued, "but I hope to see many of myfriends in it.  A room or two can easily be added; and if my friendsfind no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I willfind none in accommodating them."She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwoodto visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greateraffection.  Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law hadmade her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than wasunavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in thatpoint to which it principally tended.  To separate Edward and Elinorwas as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs.John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totallyshe disregarded her disapprobation of the match.Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorryhe was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as toprevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture.  Hereally felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the veryexertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to hisfather was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniturewas all sent around by water.  It chiefly consisted of household linen,plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's.Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could nothelp feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income would be sotrifling in comparison with their own, she should have any handsomearticle of furniture.Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished,and she might have immediate possession.  No difficulty arose on eitherside in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of hereffects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before sheset off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in theperformance of everything that interested her, was soon done.--Thehorses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after hisdeath, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage,she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldestdaughter.  For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only herown wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinorprevailed.  HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants tothree; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided fromamongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire,to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as LadyMiddleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred goingdirectly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and sherelied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as tofeel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own.Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution bythe evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of herremoval; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealedunder a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.  Now was thetime when her son-in-law's promise to his father might with particularpropriety be fulfilled.  Since he had neglected to do it on firstcoming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on asthe most suitable period for its accomplishment.  But Mrs. Dashwoodbegan shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced,from the general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extendedno farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.  He sofrequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and ofthe perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence inthe world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather tostand in need of more money himself than to have any design of givingmoney away.In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton'sfirst letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their futureabode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin theirjourney.Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place somuch beloved.  "Dear, dear Norland!" said Marianne, as she wanderedalone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; "whenshall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from thisspot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you, yewell-known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decaybecause we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although wecan observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same; unconsciousof the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of anychange in those who walk under your shade!--But who will remain toenjoy you?"The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy adisposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant.  But as theydrew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of acountry which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a viewof Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.  It was apleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture.  After windingalong it for more than a mile, they reached their own house.  A smallgreen court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicketgate admitted them into it.As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, theroof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor werethe walls covered with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directlythrough the house into the garden behind.  On each side of the entrancewas a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were theoffices and the stairs.  Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the restof the house.  It had not been built many years and was in good repair.In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but the tearswhich recollection called forth as they entered the house were soondried away.  They were cheered by the joy of the servants on theirarrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from firstseeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received animpression in its favour which was of material service in recommendingit to their lasting approbation.The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose immediatelybehind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were opendowns, the others cultivated and woody.  The village of Barton waschiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from thecottage windows.  The prospect in front was more extensive; itcommanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in thatdirection; under another name, and in another course, it branched outagain between two of the steepest of them.With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon thewhole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered manyadditions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was adelight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supplyall that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.  "As for thehouse itself, to be sure," said she, "it is too small for our family,but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as itis too late in the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring, if Ihave plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think aboutbuilding.  These parlors are both too small for such parties of ourfriends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughtsof throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of theother, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this,with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamberand garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage.  I couldwish the stairs were handsome.  But one must not expect every thing;though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them.  Ishall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, andwe will plan our improvements accordingly."In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from thesavings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never savedin her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as itwas; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns,and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, toform themselves a home.  Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked andproperly disposed of; and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the wallsof their sitting room.In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfastthe next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcomethem to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his ownhouse and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.  SirJohn Middleton was a good looking man about forty.  He had formerlyvisited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins toremember him.  His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and hismanners were as friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arrivalseemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be anobject of real solicitude to him.  He said much of his earnest desireof their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressedthem so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they werebetter settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to apoint of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence.His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after heleft them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived fromthe park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present ofgame.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to andfrom the post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction ofsending them his newspaper every day.Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting herintention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assuredthat her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message wasanswered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introducedto them the next day.They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much oftheir comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearancewas favourable to their wishes.  Lady Middleton was not more than sixor seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall andstriking, and her address graceful.  Her manners had all the elegancewhich her husband's wanted.  But they would have been improved by someshare of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough todetract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, thoughperfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say forherself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, andLady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her theireldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which meansthere was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case ofextremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty,and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hungabout her and held down his head, to the great surprise of herladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he couldmake noise enough at home.  On every formal visit a child ought to beof the party, by way of provision for discourse.  In the present caseit took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like hisfather or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for ofcourse every body differed, and every body was astonished at theopinion of the others.An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on therest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house withoutsecuring their promise of dining at the park the next day.Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.  The ladies hadpassed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened fromtheir view at home by the projection of a hill.  The house was largeand handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitalityand elegance.  The former was for Sir John's gratification, the latterfor that of his lady.  They were scarcely ever without some friendsstaying with them in the house, and they kept more company of everykind than any other family in the neighbourhood.  It was necessary tothe happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outwardbehaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want oftalent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected withsuch as society produced, within a very narrow compass.  Sir John was asportsman, Lady Middleton a mother.  He hunted and shot, and shehumoured her children; and these were their only resources.  LadyMiddleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all theyear round, while Sir John's independent employments were in existenceonly half the time.  Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported thegood spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of hiswife.Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and ofall her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was hergreatest enjoyment in any of their parties.  But Sir John'ssatisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collectingabout him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisierthey were the better was he pleased.  He was a blessing to all thejuvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for everforming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winterhis private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was notsuffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joyto him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitantshe had now procured for his cottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods wereyoung, pretty, and unaffected.  It was enough to secure his goodopinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want tomake her mind as captivating as her person.  The friendliness of hisdisposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situationmight be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  Inshowing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfactionof a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in hiscottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, isnot often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to aresidence within his own manor.Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house bySir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity;and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the youngladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the daybefore, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.  Theywould see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; aparticular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither veryyoung nor very gay.  He hoped they would all excuse the smallness ofthe party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.  Hehad been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring someaddition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was fullof engagements.  Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Bartonwithin the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman,he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they mightimagine.  The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectlysatisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished forno more.Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry,fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, andrather vulgar.  She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinnerwas over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers andhusbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.  Marianne wasvexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinorto see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gaveElinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place railleryas Mrs. Jennings's.Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted byresemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to behis wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother.  He wassilent and grave.  His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spiteof his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute oldbachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but thoughhis face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and hisaddress was particularly gentlemanlike.There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them ascompanions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middletonwas so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity ofColonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and hismother-in-law was interesting.  Lady Middleton seemed to be roused toenjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner,who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind ofdiscourse except what related to themselves.In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she wasinvited to play.  The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared tobe charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request wentthrough the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought intothe family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since inthe same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebratedthat event by giving up music, although by her mother's account, shehad played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.Marianne's performance was highly applauded.  Sir John was loud in hisadmiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversationwith the others while every song lasted.  Lady Middleton frequentlycalled him to order, wondered how any one's attention could be divertedfrom music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular songwhich Marianne had just finished.  Colonel Brandon alone, of all theparty, heard her without being in raptures.  He paid her only thecompliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on theoccasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shamelesswant of taste.  His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to thatecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, wasestimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of theothers; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five andthirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and everyexquisite power of enjoyment.  She was perfectly disposed to make everyallowance for the colonel's advanced state of life which humanityrequired.Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.  She had only twodaughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, andshe had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of theworld.  In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, asfar as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projectingweddings among all the young people of her acquaintance.  She wasremarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed theadvantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady byinsinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind ofdiscernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively topronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with MarianneDashwood.  She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first eveningof their being together, from his listening so attentively while shesang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons' diningat the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.It must be so.  She was perfectly convinced of it.  It would be anexcellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE was handsome.  Mrs. Jenningshad been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since herconnection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge; and shewas always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, forit supplied her with endless jokes against them both.  At the park shelaughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne.  To the formerher raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at firstincomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knewwhether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel'sadvanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger thanherself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy ofher daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability ofwishing to throw ridicule on his age."But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured.  Colonel Brandonis certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MYfather; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must havelong outlived every sensation of the kind.  It is too ridiculous!  Whenis a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will notprotect him?""Infirmity!" said Elinor, "do you call Colonel Brandon infirm?  I caneasily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to mymother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use ofhis limbs!""Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?  and is not that thecommonest infirmity of declining life?""My dearest child," said her mother, laughing, "at this rate you mustbe in continual terror of MY decay; and it must seem to you a miraclethat my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.""Mama, you are not doing me justice.  I know very well that ColonelBrandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive oflosing him in the course of nature.  He may live twenty years longer.But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.""Perhaps," said Elinor, "thirty-five and seventeen had better not haveany thing to do with matrimony together.  But if there should by anychance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I shouldnot think Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to hismarrying HER.""A woman of seven and twenty," said Marianne, after pausing a moment,"can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home beuncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bringherself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of theprovision and security of a wife.  In his marrying such a womantherefore there would be nothing unsuitable.  It would be a compact ofconvenience, and the world would be satisfied.  In my eyes it would beno marriage at all, but that would be nothing.  To me it would seemonly a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at theexpense of the other.""It would be impossible, I know," replied Elinor, "to convince you thata woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-fiveanything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to theconstant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced tocomplain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel inone of his shoulders.""But he talked of flannel waistcoats," said Marianne; "and with me aflannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old andthe feeble.""Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised himhalf so much.  Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting toyou in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?"Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the room, "Mama," saidMarianne, "I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannotconceal from you.  I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well.  We have nowbeen here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come.  Nothing butreal indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.  What elsecan detain him at Norland?""Had you any idea of his coming so soon?" said Mrs. Dashwood.  "I hadnone.  On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on thesubject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want ofpleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of hiscoming to Barton.  Does Elinor expect him already?""I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.""I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to heryesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observedthat there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that theroom would be wanted for some time.""How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!  But the whole oftheir behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, howcomposed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation thelast evening of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was nodistinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of anaffectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave them purposelytogether in the course of the last morning, and each time did he mostunaccountably follow me out of the room.  And Elinor, in quittingNorland and Edward, cried not as I did.  Even now her self-command isinvariable.  When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try toavoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?"The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort tothemselves.  The house and the garden, with all the objects surroundingthem, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which hadgiven to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greaterenjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of theirfather.  Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the firstfortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation athome, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, inspite of Sir John's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in theneighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always attheir service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame thewish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining tovisit any family beyond the distance of a walk.  There were but few whocould be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow windingvalley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerlydescribed, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered anancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a littleof Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to bebetter acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry, that itspossessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunatelytoo infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.  The highdowns which invited them from almost every window of the cottage toseek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happyalternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superiorbeauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret onememorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshineof a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which thesettled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned.  The weather wasnot tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and theirbook, in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would belastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn offfrom their hills; and the two girls set off together.They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration atevery glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces theanimating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fearswhich had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing suchdelightful sensations."Is there a felicity in the world," said Marianne, "superior tothis?--Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours."Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resistingit with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenlythe clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full intheir face.-- Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, thoughunwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their ownhouse.  One consolation however remained for them, to which theexigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that ofrunning with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill whichled immediately to their garden gate.They set off.  Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false stepbrought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stopherself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached thebottom in safety.A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, waspassing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when heraccident happened.  He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.  Shehad raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted inher fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.  The gentleman offeredhis services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what hersituation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without fartherdelay, and carried her down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directlyinto the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not hishold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and whilethe eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secretadmiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized forhis intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and sograceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, receivedadditional charms from his voice and expression.  Had he been even old,ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood wouldhave been secured by any act of attention to her child; but theinfluence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to theaction which came home to her feelings.She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address whichalways attended her, invited him to be seated.  But this he declined,as he was dirty and wet.  Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom shewas obliged.  His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his presenthome was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him thehonour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood.  The honourwas readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still moreinteresting, in the midst of a heavy rain.His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly thetheme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raisedagainst Marianne received particular spirit from his exteriorattractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his Mama therest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his liftingher up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after theirentering the house.  But she had seen enough of him to join in all theadmiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned herpraise.  His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawnfor the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into thehouse with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity ofthought which particularly recommended the action to her.  Everycircumstance belonging to him was interesting.  His name was good, hisresidence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out thatof all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.  Herimagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of asprained ankle was disregarded.Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weatherthat morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne's accidentbeing related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew anygentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham."Willoughby!" cried Sir John; "what, is HE in the country? That is goodnews however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner onThursday.""You know him then," said Mrs. Dashwood."Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here every year.""And what sort of a young man is he?""As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.  A very decentshot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.""And is that all you can say for him?" cried Marianne, indignantly."But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What hispursuits, his talents, and genius?"Sir John was rather puzzled."Upon my soul," said he, "I do not know much about him as to all THAT.But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicestlittle black bitch of a pointer I ever saw.  Was she out with himtoday?"But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.Willoughby's pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of hismind."But who is he?" said Elinor.  "Where does he come from?  Has he ahouse at Allenham?"On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and hetold them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in thecountry; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old ladyat Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he wasto inherit; adding, "Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I cantell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own inSomersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to myyounger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.  MissMarianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.  Brandon willbe jealous, if she does not take care.""I do not believe," said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MYdaughters towards what you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employmentto which they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us, letthem be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however, from what you say,that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will notbe ineligible.""He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived," repeatedSir John.  "I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, hedanced from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down.""Did he indeed?" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, "and withelegance, with spirit?""Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.""That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be.  Whateverbe his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, andleave him no sense of fatigue.""Aye, aye, I see how it will be," said Sir John, "I see how it will be.You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poorBrandon.""That is an expression, Sir John," said Marianne, warmly, "which Iparticularly dislike.  I abhor every common-place phrase by which witis intended; and 'setting one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,'are the most odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal; andif their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long agodestroyed all its ingenuity."Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed asheartily as if he did, and then replied,"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other.Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worthsetting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumblingabout and spraining of ankles."Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to makehis personal enquiries.  He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with morethan politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him andher own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during thevisit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introducedhim.  Of their personal charms he had not required a second interviewto be convinced.Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and aremarkably pretty figure.  Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form,though not so correct as her sister's, in having the advantage ofheight, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in thecommon cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was lessviolently outraged than usually happens.  Her skin was very brown, but,from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; herfeatures were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in hereyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness,which could hardily be seen without delight.  From Willoughby theirexpression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which theremembrance of his assistance created.  But when this passed away, whenher spirits became collected, when she saw that to the perfectgood-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, andabove all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he waspassionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as securedthe largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay.It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage herto talk.  She could not be silent when such points were introduced, andshe had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.  They speedilydiscovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, andthat it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that relatedto either.  Encouraged by this to a further examination of hisopinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; herfavourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturousa delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have beeninsensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellenceof such works, however disregarded before.  Their taste was strikinglyalike.  The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--or ifany difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer thantill the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could bedisplayed.  He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all herenthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they conversed withthe familiarity of a long-established acquaintance."Well, Marianne," said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, "for ONEmorning I think you have done pretty well.  You have alreadyascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter ofimportance.  You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you arecertain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you havereceived every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under suchextraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?  You will soonhave exhausted each favourite topic.  Another meeting will suffice toexplain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, andthen you can have nothing farther to ask."--"Elinor," cried Marianne, "is this fair? is this just? are my ideas soscanty?  But I see what you mean.  I have been too much at my ease, toohappy, too frank.  I have erred against every common-place notion ofdecorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have beenreserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had I talked only of theweather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, thisreproach would have been spared.""My love," said her mother, "you must not be offended with Elinor--shewas only in jest.  I should scold her myself, if she were capable ofwishing to check the delight of your conversation with our newfriend."-- Marianne was softened in a moment.Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in theiracquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer.  Hecame to them every day.  To enquire after Marianne was at first hisexcuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day gavegreater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceasedto be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery.  She was confined forsome days to the house; but never had any confinement been lessirksome.  Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quickimagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners.  He wasexactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joinednot only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which wasnow roused and increased by the example of her own, and whichrecommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.  They read,they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were considerable;and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward hadunfortunately wanted.In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne's; andElinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which hestrongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying toomuch what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons orcircumstances.  In hastily forming and giving his opinion of otherpeople, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undividedattention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily theforms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinorcould not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say inits support.Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seizedher at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy herideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby wasall that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in everybrighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviourdeclared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilitieswere strong.Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of theirmarriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before theend of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulateherself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so early beendiscovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, whenit ceased to be noticed by them.  Their attention and wit were drawnoff to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other hadincurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelingsbegan really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentimentswhich Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were nowactually excited by her sister; and that however a general resemblanceof disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was nohindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern;for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to avery lively one of five and twenty? and as she could not even wish himsuccessful, she heartily wished him indifferent.  She liked him--inspite of his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object ofinterest.  His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserveappeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of anynatural gloominess of temper.  Sir John had dropped hints of pastinjuries and disappointments, which justified her belief of his beingan unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion.Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted byWilloughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neitherlively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits."Brandon is just the kind of man," said Willoughby one day, when theywere talking of him together, "whom every body speaks well of, andnobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembersto talk to.""That is exactly what I think of him," cried Marianne."Do not boast of it, however," said Elinor, "for it is injustice inboth of you.  He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, andI never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.""That he is patronised by YOU," replied Willoughby, "is certainly inhis favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach initself.  Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such awoman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command theindifference of any body else?""But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne willmake amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother.  If theirpraise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not moreundiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.""In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.""My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will alwayshave attractions for me.  Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirtyand forty.  He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad, hasread, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him capable of giving memuch information on various subjects; and he has always answered myinquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.""That is to say," cried Marianne contemptuously, "he has told you, thatin the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes aretroublesome.""He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries,but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed.""Perhaps," said Willoughby, "his observations may have extended to theexistence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.""I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much furtherthan your candour.  But why should you dislike him?""I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary, as a veryrespectable man, who has every body's good word, and nobody's notice;who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how toemploy, and two new coats every year.""Add to which," cried Marianne, "that he has neither genius, taste, norspirit.  That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings noardour, and his voice no expression.""You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass," replied Elinor,"and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that thecommendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold andinsipid.  I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiableheart.""Miss Dashwood," cried Willoughby, "you are now using me unkindly.  Youare endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against mywill.  But it will not do.  You shall find me as stubborn as you can beartful.  I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking ColonelBrandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he hasfound fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade himto buy my brown mare.  If it will be any satisfaction to you, however,to be told, that I believe his character to be in other respectsirreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return for anacknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me theprivilege of disliking him as much as ever."Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first cameinto Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy theirtime as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have suchfrequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them littleleisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.  When Mariannewas recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which SirJohn had been previously forming, were put into execution.  The privateballs at the park then began; and parties on the water were made andaccomplished as often as a showery October would allow.  In everymeeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease andfamiliarity which naturally attended these parties were exactlycalculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with theDashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies ofMarianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of heraffection.Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.  She only wishedthat it were less openly shewn; and once or twice did venture tosuggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne.  But Marianneabhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselvesillaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but adisgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was anillustration of their opinions.When he was present she had no eyes for any one else.  Every thing hedid, was right.  Every thing he said, was clever.  If their evenings atthe park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the restof the party to get her a good hand.  If dancing formed the amusementof the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged toseparate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together andscarcely spoke a word to any body else.  Such conduct made them ofcourse most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, andseemed hardly to provoke them.Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which lefther no inclination for checking this excessive display of them.  To herit was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young andardent mind.This was the season of happiness to Marianne.  Her heart was devoted toWilloughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought withher from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought itpossible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on herpresent home.Elinor's happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not so much atease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure.  They affordedher no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret thanever.  Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her theconversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker,and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her alarge share of her discourse.  She had already repeated her own historyto Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been equal toher means of improvement, she might have known very early in theiracquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, andwhat he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.  Lady Middletonwas more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.  Elinorneeded little observation to perceive that her reserve was a merecalmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.  Towards herhusband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy wastherefore neither to be looked for nor desired.  She had nothing to sayone day that she had not said the day before.  Her insipidity wasinvariable, for even her spirits were always the same; and though shedid not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided everything were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her,she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she mighthave experienced in sitting at home;--and so little did her presenceadd to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation,that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by hersolicitude about her troublesome boys.In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor finda person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excitethe interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.Willoughby was out of the question.  Her admiration and regard, evenher sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; hisattentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man mighthave been more generally pleasing.  Colonel Brandon, unfortunately forhimself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and inconversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for theindifference of her sister.Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspectthat the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped fromhim one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together bymutual consent, while the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed onMarianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faintsmile, "Your sister, I understand, does not approve of secondattachments.""No," replied Elinor, "her opinions are all romantic.""Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.""I believe she does.  But how she contrives it without reflecting onthe character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not.A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis ofcommon sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to defineand to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.""This will probably be the case," he replied; "and yet there issomething so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one issorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.""I cannot agree with you there," said Elinor.  "There areinconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne's, which all thecharms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Hersystems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety atnought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forwardto as her greatest possible advantage."After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,--"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against asecond attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body?  Are thosewho have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from theinconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to beequally indifferent during the rest of their lives?""Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles.I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a secondattachment's being pardonable.""This," said he, "cannot hold; but a change, a total change ofsentiments--No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinementsof a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are theysucceeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous!  Ispeak from experience.  I once knew a lady who in temper and mindgreatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but whofrom an inforced change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances"--Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much,and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might nototherwise have entered Elinor's head.  The lady would probably havepassed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that whatconcerned her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was, it required buta slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tenderrecollection of past regard.  Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne,in her place, would not have done so little.  The whole story wouldhave been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thingestablished in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning thelatter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite ofall that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.  Marianne told her,with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, onethat he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which wasexactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering that it wasnot in her mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alterher resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for theservant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stableto receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, andtold her sister of it in raptures."He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,"she added, "and when it arrives we will ride every day.  You shallshare its use with me.  Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, thedelight of a gallop on some of these downs."Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity tocomprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and forsome time she refused to submit to them.  As to an additional servant,the expense would be a trifle; Mama she was sure would never object toit; and any horse would do for HIM; he might always get one at thepark; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.  Elinor thenventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from aman so little, or at least so lately known to her.  This was too much."You are mistaken, Elinor," said she warmly, "in supposing I know verylittle of Willoughby.  I have not known him long indeed, but I am muchbetter acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in theworld, except yourself and mama.  It is not time or opportunity that isto determine intimacy;--it is disposition alone.  Seven years would beinsufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and sevendays are more than enough for others.  I should hold myself guilty ofgreater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than fromWilloughby.  Of John I know very little, though we have lived togetherfor years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed."Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.  She knew hersister's temper.  Opposition on so tender a subject would only attachher the more to her own opinion.  But by an appeal to her affection forher mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgentmother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) sheconsented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortlysubdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudentkindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she sawhim next, that it must be declined.She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at thecottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment tohim in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of hispresent.  The reasons for this alteration were at the same timerelated, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his sideimpossible.  His concern however was very apparent; and afterexpressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice,--"But,Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now.  Ishall keep it only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton toform your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shallreceive you."This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of thesentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing hersister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy sodecided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement betweenthem.  From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to eachother; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, orany of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discoverit by accident.Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed thismatter in a still clearer light.  Willoughby had spent the precedingevening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlourwith only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations,which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldestsister, when they were next by themselves."Oh, Elinor!" she cried, "I have such a secret to tell you aboutMarianne.  I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.""You have said so," replied Elinor, "almost every day since they firstmet on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, Ibelieve, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture roundher neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our greatuncle.""But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure they will bemarried very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.""Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the hair of some great uncle ofHIS.""But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am almost sure it is, for Isaw him cut it off.  Last night after tea, when you and mama went outof the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as couldbe, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he tookup her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was alltumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece ofwhite paper; and put it into his pocket-book."For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could notwithhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstancewas in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactoryto her sister.  When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at thepark, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor's particularfavourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, "I must nottell, may I, Elinor?"This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.But the effort was painful.  She was convinced that Margaret had fixedon a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become astanding joke with Mrs. Jennings.Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than goodto the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner toMargaret,"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right torepeat them.""I never had any conjectures about it," replied Margaret; "it was youwho told me of it yourself."This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerlypressed to say something more."Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it," said Mrs.Jennings.  "What is the gentleman's name?""I must not tell, ma'am. But I know very well what it is; and I knowwhere he is too.""Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to besure.  He is the curate of the parish I dare say.""No, THAT he is not.  He is of no profession at all.""Margaret," said Marianne with great warmth, "you know that all this isan invention of your own, and that there is no such person inexistence.""Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was sucha man once, and his name begins with an F."Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at thismoment, "that it rained very hard," though she believed theinterruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from herladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery asdelighted her husband and mother.  The idea however started by her, wasimmediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasionmindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject ofrain by both of them.  Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and askedMarianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours ofdifferent people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.  But not soeasily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see avery fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to abrother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could notbe seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orderson that head.  The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, andSir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowedto be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, atleast, twice every summer for the last ten years.  They contained anoble piece of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of themorning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriagesonly to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of acomplete party of pleasure.To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for thelast fortnight;--and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, waspersuaded by Elinor to stay at home.Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different fromwhat Elinor had expected.  She was prepared to be wet through,fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, forthey did not go at all.By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where theywere to breakfast.  The morning was rather favourable, though it hadrained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,and the sun frequently appeared.  They were all in high spirits andgood humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to thegreatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in.  Among therest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he took it, looked at thedirection, changed colour, and immediately left the room."What is the matter with Brandon?" said Sir John.Nobody could tell."I hope he has had no bad news," said Lady Middleton.  "It must besomething extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave mybreakfast table so suddenly."In about five minutes he returned."No bad news, Colonel, I hope;" said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as heentered the room."None at all, ma'am, I thank you.""Was it from Avignon?  I hope it is not to say that your sister isworse.""No, ma'am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.""But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only aletter of business?  Come, come, this won't do, Colonel; so let us hearthe truth of it.""My dear madam," said Lady Middleton, "recollect what you are saying.""Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?" saidMrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter's reproof."No, indeed, it is not.""Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.  And I hope she is well.""Whom do you mean, ma'am?" said he, colouring a little."Oh! you know who I mean.""I am particularly sorry, ma'am," said he, addressing Lady Middleton,"that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business whichrequires my immediate attendance in town.""In town!" cried Mrs. Jennings.  "What can you have to do in town atthis time of year?""My own loss is great," he continued, "in being obliged to leave soagreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presenceis necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell."What a blow upon them all was this!"But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon," saidMarianne, eagerly, "will it not be sufficient?"He shook his head."We must go," said Sir John.--"It shall not be put off when we are sonear it.  You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.""I wish it could be so easily settled.  But it is not in my power todelay my journey for one day!""If you would but let us know what your business is," said Mrs.Jennings, "we might see whether it could be put off or not.""You would not be six hours later," said Willoughby, "if you were todefer your journey till our return.""I cannot afford to lose ONE hour."--Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, "Thereare some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.  Brandon is one ofthem.  He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented thistrick for getting out of it.  I would lay fifty guineas the letter wasof his own writing.""I have no doubt of it," replied Marianne."There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know ofold," said Sir John, "when once you are determined on anything.  But,however, I hope you will think better of it.  Consider, here are thetwo Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walkedup from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before hisusual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell."Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause ofdisappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to beunavoidable."Well, then, when will you come back again?""I hope we shall see you at Barton," added her ladyship, "as soon asyou can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party toWhitwell till you return.""You are very obliging.  But it is so uncertain, when I may have it inmy power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.""Oh! he must and shall come back," cried Sir John.  "If he is not hereby the end of the week, I shall go after him.""Ay, so do, Sir John," cried Mrs. Jennings, "and then perhaps you mayfind out what his business is.""I do not want to pry into other men's concerns.  I suppose it issomething he is ashamed of."Colonel Brandon's horses were announced."You do not go to town on horseback, do you?" added Sir John."No. Only to Honiton.  I shall then go post.""Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey.  But youhad better change your mind.""I assure you it is not in my power."He then took leave of the whole party."Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town thiswinter, Miss Dashwood?""I am afraid, none at all.""Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish todo."To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing."Come Colonel," said Mrs. Jennings, "before you go, do let us know whatyou are going about."He wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the room.The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hithertorestrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again andagain how provoking it was to be so disappointed."I can guess what his business is, however," said Mrs. Jenningsexultingly."Can you, ma'am?" said almost every body."Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.""And who is Miss Williams?" asked Marianne."What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must haveheard of her before.  She is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; avery near relation.  We will not say how near, for fear of shocking theyoung ladies." Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,"She is his natural daughter.""Indeed!""Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.  I dare say the Colonelwill leave her all his fortune."When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regreton so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that asthey were all got together, they must do something by way of beinghappy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that althoughhappiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure atolerable composure of mind by driving about the country.  Thecarriages were then ordered; Willoughby's was first, and Marianne neverlooked happier than when she got into it.  He drove through the parkvery fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of themwas seen till their return, which did not happen till after the returnof all the rest.  They both seemed delighted with their drive; but saidonly in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the otherswent on the downs.It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and thatevery body should be extremely merry all day long.  Some more of theCareys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearlytwenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not been longseated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said toMarianne, loud enough for them both to hear, "I have found you out inspite of all your tricks.  I know where you spent the morning."Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, "Where, pray?"--"Did not you know," said Willoughby, "that we had been out in mycurricle?""Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determinedto find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house, MissMarianne.  It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you,I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much whenI was there six years ago."Marianne turned away in great confusion.  Mrs. Jennings laughedheartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where theyhad been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.Willoughby's groom; and that she had by that method been informed thatthey had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there inwalking about the garden and going all over the house.Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikelythat Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the housewhile Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallestacquaintance.As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstancerelated by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angrywith her for doubting it."Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that wedid not see the house?  Is not it what you have often wished to doyourself?""Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and withno other companion than Mr. Willoughby.""Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shewthat house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible tohave any other companion.  I never spent a pleasanter morning in mylife.""I am afraid," replied Elinor, "that the pleasantness of an employmentdoes not always evince its propriety.""On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for ifthere had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have beensensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are actingwrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.""But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some veryimpertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion ofyour own conduct?""If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof ofimpropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives.I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation.  Iam not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs.Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house.  They will one day be Mr.Willoughby's, and--""If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not bejustified in what you have done."She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her;and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought, she came to hersister again, and said with great good humour, "Perhaps, Elinor, it WASrather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wantedparticularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assureyou.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nicecomfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it wouldbe delightful.  It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.  Onone side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to abeautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the churchand village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have sooften admired.  I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could bemore forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up--acouple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of thepleasantest summer-rooms in England."Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others,she would have described every room in the house with equal delight.The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with hissteadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised thewonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a greatwonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in allthe comings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She wondered, withlittle intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there mustbe some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that couldhave befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escapethem all."Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure," said she."I could see it in his face.  Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstancesmay be bad.  The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than twothousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.  I dothink he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else canit be?  I wonder whether it is so.  I would give anything to know thetruth of it.  Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I daresay it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.  May beshe is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have anotion she is always rather sickly.  I would lay any wager it is aboutMiss Williams.  It is not so very likely he should be distressed in hiscircumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure musthave cleared the estate by this time.  I wonder what it can be!  May behis sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His settingoff in such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out of allhis trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain."So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion varying with everyfresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of ColonelBrandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away,which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides that thecircumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement orvariety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It wasengrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby onthe subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to themall.  As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strangeand more incompatible with the disposition of both.  Why they shouldnot openly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constantbehaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could notimagine.She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately intheir power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reasonto believe him rich.  His estate had been rated by Sir John at aboutsix or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which thatincome could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained ofhis poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by themrelative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all,she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to theirgeneral opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mindof their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent hermaking any inquiry of Marianne.Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, thanWilloughby's behaviour.  To Marianne it had all the distinguishingtenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of thefamily it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  Thecottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many moreof his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no generalengagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called himout in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the restof the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by hisfavourite pointer at her feet.One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left thecountry, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling ofattachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's happeningto mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmlyopposed every alteration of a place which affection had established asperfect with him."What!" he exclaimed--"Improve this dear cottage!  No. THAT I willnever consent to.  Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inchto its size, if my feelings are regarded.""Do not be alarmed," said Miss Dashwood, "nothing of the kind will bedone; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.""I am heartily glad of it," he cried.  "May she always be poor, if shecan employ her riches no better.""Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I would notsacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any onewhom I loved, for all the improvements in the world.  Depend upon itthat whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts inthe spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of itin a manner so painful to you.  But are you really so attached to thisplace as to see no defect in it?""I am," said he.  "To me it is faultless.  Nay, more, I consider it asthe only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were Irich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again inthe exact plan of this cottage.""With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose," saidElinor."Yes," cried he in the same eager tone, "with all and every thingbelonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about it,should the least variation be perceptible.  Then, and then only, undersuch a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been atBarton.""I flatter myself," replied Elinor, "that even under the disadvantageof better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find yourown house as faultless as you now do this.""There certainly are circumstances," said Willoughby, "which mightgreatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim ofmy affection, which no other can possibly share."Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes werefixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well sheunderstood him."How often did I wish," added he, "when I was at Allenham this timetwelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited!  I never passed withinview of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no oneshould live in it.  How little did I then think that the very firstnews I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediatesatisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind ofprescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can accountfor.  Must it not have been so, Marianne?" speaking to her in a loweredvoice.  Then continuing his former tone, he said, "And yet this houseyou would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it of its simplicity byimaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintancefirst began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent byus together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,and every body would be eager to pass through the room which hashitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfortthan any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the worldcould possibly afford."Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind shouldbe attempted."You are a good woman," he warmly replied.  "Your promise makes meeasy.  Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy.  Tell methat not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall everfind you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you willalways consider me with the kindness which has made everythingbelonging to you so dear to me."The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's behaviour during thewhole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness."Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?" said Mrs. Dashwood, when he wasleaving them.  "I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we mustwalk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton."He engaged to be with them by four o'clock.Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, andtwo of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself frombeing of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and hermother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby thenight before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectlysatisfied with her remaining at home.On their return from the park they found Willoughby's curricle andservant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced thather conjecture had been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught herto expect.  They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne camehastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with herhandkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she hadjust quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning againstthe mantel-piece with his back towards them.  He turned round on theircoming in, and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of theemotion which over-powered Marianne."Is anything the matter with her?" cried Mrs. Dashwood as sheentered--"is she ill?""I hope not," he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forcedsmile presently added, "It is I who may rather expect to be ill--for Iam now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!""Disappointment?""Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.  Mrs. Smith hasthis morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependentcousin, by sending me on business to London.  I have just received mydispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way ofexhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.""To London!--and are you going this morning?""Almost this moment.""This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and herbusiness will not detain you from us long I hope."He coloured as he replied, "You are very kind, but I have no idea ofreturning into Devonshire immediately.  My visits to Mrs. Smith arenever repeated within the twelvemonth.""And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only house in theneighbourhood to which you will be welcome?  For shame, Willoughby, canyou wait for an invitation here?"His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he onlyreplied, "You are too good."Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.  Elinor felt equalamazement.  For a few moments every one was silent.  Mrs. Dashwoodfirst spoke."I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage youwill always be welcome; for I will not press you to return hereimmediately, because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasingto Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to questionyour judgment than to doubt your inclination.""My engagements at present," replied Willoughby, confusedly, "are ofsuch a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself"--He stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and anotherpause succeeded.  This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faintsmile, "It is folly to linger in this manner.  I will not tormentmyself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it isimpossible for me now to enjoy."He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room.  They saw himstep into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted theparlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which thissudden departure occasioned.Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's.  She thought ofwhat had just passed with anxiety and distrust.  Willoughby's behaviourin taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation ofcheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother'sinvitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself,greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared that no serious designhad ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunatequarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress inwhich Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel couldmost reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne'slove for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister'saffliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderestcompassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probabilitynot merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as aduty.In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes werered, her countenance was not uncheerful."Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor," said she,as she sat down to work, "and with how heavy a heart does he travel?""It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the workof a moment.  And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, soaffectionate?  And now, after only ten minutes notice--Gone too withoutintending to return!--Something more than what he owned to us must havehappened.  He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.  YOU musthave seen the difference as well as I.  What can it be?  Can they havequarrelled?  Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to acceptyour invitation here?"--"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly seeTHAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.  I have thought it allover I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that atfirst seemed strange to me as well as to you.""Can you, indeed!""Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--butyou, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy YOU,I know; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I ampersuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapprovesof it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on thataccount is eager to get him away;--and that the business which shesends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.This is what I believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware thatshe DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at presentconfess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himselfobliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, andabsent himself from Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil,unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affairas satisfactory at this.  And now, Elinor, what have you to say?""Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.""Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened.Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings!  You had rathertake evil upon credit than good.  You had rather look out for miseryfor Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for thelatter.  You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leaveof us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn.  And isno allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed byrecent disappointment?  Are no probabilities to be accepted, merelybecause they are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom wehave all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think illof?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, thoughunavoidably secret for a while?  And, after all, what is it you suspecthim of?""I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of something unpleasant isthe inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessedin him.  There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged ofthe allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to becandid in my judgment of every body.  Willoughby may undoubtedly havevery sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them atonce.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering atits being practiced by him.""Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where thedeviation is necessary.  But you really do admit the justice of what Ihave said in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.""Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if theyARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--and if that is the case, it must behighly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire atpresent.  But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.""Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby andMarianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes havebeen reproaching them every day for incautiousness.""I want no proof of their affection," said Elinor; "but of theirengagement I do.""I am perfectly satisfied of both.""Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either ofthem.""I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly.  Hasnot his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the lastfortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his futurewife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?Have we not perfectly understood each other?  Has not my consent beendaily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionaterespect?  My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement?  Howcould such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed thatWilloughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister's love, should leaveher, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of hisaffection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange ofconfidence?""I confess," replied Elinor, "that every circumstance except ONE is infavour of their engagement; but that ONE is the total silence of bothon the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.""How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt thenature of the terms on which they are together.  Has he been acting apart in his behaviour to your sister all this time?  Do you suppose himreally indifferent to her?""No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her I am sure.""But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with suchindifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him.""You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered thismatter as certain.  I have had my doubts, I confess; but they arefainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away.  If wefind they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.""A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see them at the altar, youwould suppose they were going to be married.  Ungracious girl!  But Irequire no such proof.  Nothing in my opinion has ever passed tojustify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformlyopen and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.  It mustbe Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?  Is he not a man ofhonour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side tocreate alarm? can he be deceitful?""I hope not, I believe not," cried Elinor.  "I love Willoughby,sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be morepainful to yourself than to me.  It has been involuntary, and I willnot encourage it.  I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in hismanners this morning;--he did not speak like himself, and did notreturn your kindness with any cordiality.  But all this may beexplained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed.  Hehad just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatestaffliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet awarethat by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away forsome time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part byour family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such acase, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been moreto his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his generalcharacter;--but I will not raise objections against any one's conducton so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.""You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does not deserve to besuspected.  Though WE have not known him long, he is no stranger inthis part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledgingeverything to me at once: but this is not the case.  It is anengagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriagemust be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as itcan be observed, may now be very advisable."They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was thenat liberty to think over the representations of her mother, toacknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered theroom and took her place at the table without saying a word.  Her eyeswere red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even thenrestrained with difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all, couldneither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother's silentlypressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of fortitudewas quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening.  Shewas without any power, because she was without any desire of commandover herself.  The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughbyoverpowered her in an instant; and though her family were mostanxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if theyspoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelingsconnected with him.Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been ableto sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby.  Shewould have been ashamed to look her family in the face the nextmorning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose thanwhen she lay down in it.  But the feelings which made such composure adisgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it.  She was awake thewhole night, and she wept the greatest part of it.  She got up with aheadache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding allattempt at consolation from either.  Her sensibility was potent enough!When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered aboutthe village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoymentand crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.  She playedover every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby,every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat atthe instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written outfor her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could begained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied.  She spentwhole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her voiceoften totally suspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as inmusic, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past andpresent was certain of giving.  She read nothing but what they had beenused to read together.Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; itsunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments,to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and silent meditations,still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy.  But Mrs.Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which atleast satisfied herself."Remember, Elinor," said she, "how very often Sir John fetches ourletters himself from the post, and carries them to it.  We have alreadyagreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that itcould not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass throughSir John's hands."Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it amotive sufficient for their silence.  But there was one method sodirect, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the realstate of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that shecould not help suggesting it to her mother."Why do you not ask Marianne at once," said she, "whether she is or sheis not engaged to Willoughby?  From you, her mother, and so kind, soindulgent a mother, the question could not give offence.  It would bethe natural result of your affection for her.  She used to be allunreserve, and to you more especially.""I would not ask such a question for the world.  Supposing it possiblethat they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiryinflict!  At any rate it would be most ungenerous.  I should neverdeserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession ofwhat is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.  I knowMarianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall notbe the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances makethe revealment of it eligible.  I would not attempt to force theconfidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of dutywould prevent the denial which her wishes might direct."Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister'syouth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, commoncare, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romanticdelicacy.It was several days before Willoughby's name was mentioned beforeMarianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, werenot so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--butone evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume ofShakespeare, exclaimed,"We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went awaybefore we could get through it.  We will put it by, that when he comesagain...But it may be months, perhaps, before THAT happens.""Months!" cried Marianne, with strong surprise.  "No--nor many weeks."Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said; but it gave Elinorpleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive ofconfidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions.One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne wasprevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead ofwandering away by herself.  Hitherto she had carefully avoided everycompanion in her rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on thedowns, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of thevalley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never befound when the others set off.  But at length she was secured by theexertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied withgaining one point, would not then attempt more.  Beyond the entrance ofthe valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild andmore open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on firstcoming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, theystopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed thedistance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they hadnever happened to reach in any of their walks before.Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one;it was a man on horseback riding towards them.  In a few minutes theycould distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwardsMarianne rapturously exclaimed,"It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!"--and was hastening to meethim, when Elinor cried out,"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is not Willoughby.The person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.""He has, he has," cried Marianne, "I am sure he has.  His air, hiscoat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come."She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne fromparticularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby,quickened her pace and kept up with her.  They were soon within thirtyyards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again; her heart sunk withinher; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voicesof both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as wellknown as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop, and sheturned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.He was the only person in the world who could at that moment beforgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained asmile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in hersister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back withthem to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially byMarianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him thaneven Elinor herself.  To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edwardand her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldnesswhich she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.  OnEdward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that alover ought to look and say on such an occasion.  He was confused,seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neitherrapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him byquestions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.  Mariannesaw and listened with increasing surprise.  She began almost to feel adislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, bycarrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed acontrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiriesof meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London.  No,he had been in Devonshire a fortnight."A fortnight!" she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the samecounty with Elinor without seeing her before.He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying withsome friends near Plymouth."Have you been lately in Sussex?" said Elinor."I was at Norland about a month ago.""And how does dear, dear Norland look?" cried Marianne."Dear, dear Norland," said Elinor, "probably looks much as it alwaysdoes at this time of the year.  The woods and walks thickly coveredwith dead leaves.""Oh," cried Marianne, "with what transporting sensation have I formerlyseen them fall!  How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them drivenin showers about me by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season,the air altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.  Theyare seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much aspossible from the sight.""It is not every one," said Elinor, "who has your passion for deadleaves.""No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood.  ButSOMETIMES they are."--As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for afew moments;--but rousing herself again, "Now, Edward," said she,calling his attention to the prospect, "here is Barton valley.  Look upto it, and be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!  Did you eversee their equals?  To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods andplantations.  You may see the end of the house.  And there, beneaththat farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.""It is a beautiful country," he replied; "but these bottoms must bedirty in winter.""How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?""Because," replied he, smiling, "among the rest of the objects beforeme, I see a very dirty lane.""How strange!" said Marianne to herself as she walked on."Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the Middletons pleasantpeople?""No, not all," answered Marianne; "we could not be more unfortunatelysituated.""Marianne," cried her sister, "how can you say so? How can you be sounjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towardsus have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you forgot, Marianne,how many pleasant days we have owed to them?""No," said Marianne, in a low voice, "nor how many painful moments."Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to theirvisitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, bytalking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extortingfrom him occasional questions and remarks.  His coldness and reservemortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving toregulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, sheavoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated himas she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; for hiscoming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder.  He receivedthe kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could notstand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him before heentered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivatingmanners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man could not very well be in lovewith either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; andElinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more likehimself.  His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and hisinterest in their welfare again became perceptible.  He was not inspirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, wasattentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits.  The whole familyperceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want ofliberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against allselfish parents."What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present, Edward?" said she,when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; "are you stillto be a great orator in spite of yourself?""No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents thaninclination for a public life!""But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be tosatisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, noaffection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may findit a difficult matter.""I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be distinguished; and haveevery reason to hope I never shall.  Thank Heaven! I cannot be forcedinto genius and eloquence.""You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes are all moderate.""As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe.  I wish aswell as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every bodyelse it must be in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.""Strange that it would!" cried Marianne.  "What have wealth or grandeurto do with happiness?""Grandeur has but little," said Elinor, "but wealth has much to do withit.""Elinor, for shame!" said Marianne, "money can only give happinesswhere there is nothing else to give it.  Beyond a competence, it canafford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.""Perhaps," said Elinor, smiling, "we may come to the same point.  YOURcompetence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and withoutthem, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind ofexternal comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas are only more noble thanmine.  Come, what is your competence?""About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than THAT."Elinor laughed.  "TWO thousand a year! ONE is my wealth! I guessed howit would end.""And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income," said Marianne."A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller.  I am sure I am notextravagant in my demands.  A proper establishment of servants, acarriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less."Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately theirfuture expenses at Combe Magna."Hunters!" repeated Edward--"but why must you have hunters?  Every bodydoes not hunt."Marianne coloured as she replied, "But most people do.""I wish," said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, "that somebodywould give us all a large fortune apiece!""Oh that they would!" cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling withanimation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginaryhappiness."We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose," said Elinor, "in spiteof the insufficiency of wealth.""Oh dear!" cried Margaret, "how happy I should be!  I wonder what Ishould do with it!"Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point."I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself," said Mrs.Dashwood, "if my children were all to be rich without my help.""You must begin your improvements on this house," observed Elinor, "andyour difficulties will soon vanish.""What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London," saidEdward, "in such an event!  What a happy day for booksellers,music-sellers, and print-shops!  You, Miss Dashwood, would give ageneral commission for every new print of merit to be sent you--and asfor Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be musicenough in London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy upevery copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands;and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an oldtwisted tree.  Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am verysaucy.  But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our olddisputes.""I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it be melancholy orgay, I love to recall it--and you will never offend me by talking offormer times.  You are very right in supposing how my money would bespent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly be employedin improving my collection of music and books.""And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on theauthors or their heirs.""No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.""Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person whowrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can everbe in love more than once in their life--your opinion on that point isunchanged, I presume?""Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.  It isnot likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.""Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see," said Elinor, "she is notat all altered.""She is only grown a little more grave than she was.""Nay, Edward," said Marianne, "you need not reproach me.  You are notvery gay yourself.""Why should you think so!" replied he, with a sigh.  "But gaiety neverwas a part of MY character.""Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's," said Elinor; "I should hardlycall her a lively girl--she is very earnest, very eager in all shedoes--sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation--but sheis not often really merry.""I believe you are right," he replied, "and yet I have always set herdown as a lively girl.""I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes," saidElinor, "in a total misapprehension of character in some point orother: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious orstupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what thedeception originated.  Sometimes one is guided by what they say ofthemselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.""But I thought it was right, Elinor," said Marianne, "to be guidedwholly by the opinion of other people.  I thought our judgments weregiven us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours.  This hasalways been your doctrine, I am sure.""No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection ofthe understanding.  All I have ever attempted to influence has been thebehaviour.  You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general withgreater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt theirsentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?""You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan ofgeneral civility," said Edward to Elinor.  "Do you gain no ground?""Quite the contrary," replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne."My judgment," he returned, "is all on your side of the question; but Iam afraid my practice is much more on your sister's.  I never wish tooffend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when Iam only kept back by my natural awkwardness.  I have frequently thoughtthat I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, Iam so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!""Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers," saidElinor."She knows her own worth too well for false shame," replied Edward."Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way orother.  If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easyand graceful, I should not be shy.""But you would still be reserved," said Marianne, "and that is worse."Edward started--"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?""Yes, very.""I do not understand you," replied he, colouring.  "Reserved!--how, inwhat manner?  What am I to tell you?  What can you suppose?"Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off thesubject, she said to him, "Do not you know my sister well enough tounderstand what she means?  Do not you know she calls every onereserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires asrapturously as herself?"Edward made no answer.  His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on himin their fullest extent--and he sat for some time silent and dull.Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend.  Hisvisit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his ownenjoyment in it appeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he wasunhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguishedher by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt ofinspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed veryuncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradictedone moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morningbefore the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager topromote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them tothemselves.  But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlourdoor open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himselfcome out."I am going into the village to see my horses," said he, "as you arenot yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently."                    ***Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surroundingcountry; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of thevalley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situationthan the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which hadexceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured Marianne'sattention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration ofthese scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that hadparticularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying, "Youmust not enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge in thepicturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of tasteif we come to particulars.  I shall call hills steep, which ought to bebold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular andrugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to beindistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.  You must besatisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give.  I call it avery fine country--the hills are steep, the woods seem full of finetimber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich meadowsand several neat farm houses scattered here and there.  It exactlyanswers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty withutility--and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admireit; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, greymoss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.  I know nothing ofthe picturesque.""I am afraid it is but too true," said Marianne; "but why should youboast of it?""I suspect," said Elinor, "that to avoid one kind of affectation,Edward here falls into another.  Because he believes many peoplepretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they reallyfeel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greaterindifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than hepossesses.  He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.""It is very true," said Marianne, "that admiration of landscape sceneryis become a mere jargon.  Every body pretends to feel and tries todescribe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined whatpicturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes Ihave kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language todescribe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense andmeaning.""I am convinced," said Edward, "that you really feel all the delight ina fine prospect which you profess to feel.  But, in return, your sistermust allow me to feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,but not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked, twisted,blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, andflourishing.  I do not like ruined, tattered cottages.  I am not fondof nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in asnug farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy, happy villagesplease me better than the finest banditti in the world."Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at hersister.  Elinor only laughed.The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remainedthoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plaitof hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers."I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward," she cried.  "Is thatFanny's hair? I remember her promising to give you some.  But I shouldhave thought her hair had been darker."Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--but when she sawhow much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thoughtcould not be surpassed by his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving amomentary glance at Elinor, replied, "Yes; it is my sister's hair.  Thesetting always casts a different shade on it, you know."Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.  That the hairwas her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianneconsidered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious musthave been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, andaffecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking ofsomething else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch everyopportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond alldoubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own.Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence ofmind still more settled.  He was particularly grave the whole morning.Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her ownforgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how littleoffence it had given her sister.Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at thecottage, came to take a survey of the guest.  With the assistance ofhis mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the nameof Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of railleryagainst the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of theiracquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediatelysprung.  But, as it was, she only learned, from some very significantlooks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions,extended.Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them todine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening.On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor,towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he wishedto engage them for both."You MUST drink tea with us to night," said he, "for we shall be quitealone--and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall be alarge party."Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.  "And who knows but you may raisea dance," said she.  "And that will tempt YOU, Miss Marianne.""A dance!" cried Marianne.  "Impossible! Who is to dance?""Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.--What!you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall benameless is gone!""I wish with all my soul," cried Sir John, "that Willoughby were amongus again."This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward.  "And whois Willoughby?" said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom hewas sitting.She gave him a brief reply.  Marianne's countenance was morecommunicative.  Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaningof others, but such of Marianne's expressions as had puzzled himbefore; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately roundher, and said, in a whisper, "I have been guessing.  Shall I tell youmy guess?""What do you mean?""Shall I tell you.""Certainly.""Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts."Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling atthe quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment's silence, said,"Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come I hope...I am sureyou will like him.""I do not doubt it," replied he, rather astonished at her earnestnessand warmth; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of heracquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothingbetween Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured tomention it.Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs.Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only onself-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoymentamong his friends was at the height.  His spirits, during the last twoor three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--hegrew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke ofgoing away without a sigh--declared his time to be whollydisengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he leftthem--but still, go he must.  Never had any week passed so quickly--hecould hardly believe it to be gone.  He said so repeatedly; otherthings he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave thelie to his actions.  He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested beingin town; but either to Norland or London, he must go.  He valued theirkindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being withthem.  Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of theirwishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time.Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to hismother's account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whosecharacter was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excusefor every thing strange on the part of her son.  Disappointed, however,and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertainbehaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regardhis actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, forWilloughby's service, by her mother.  His want of spirits, of openness,and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want ofindependence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's dispositionand designs.  The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purposein leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the sameinevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.  The oldwell-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child,was the cause of all.  She would have been glad to know when thesedifficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs.Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.  Butfrom such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewalof her confidence in Edward's affection, to the remembrance of everymark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton, andabove all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore roundhis finger."I think, Edward," said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast thelast morning, "you would be a happier man if you had any profession toengage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions.  Someinconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you wouldnot be able to give them so much of your time.  But (with a smile) youwould be materially benefited in one particular at least--you wouldknow where to go when you left them.""I do assure you," he replied, "that I have long thought on this point,as you think now.  It has been, and is, and probably will always be aheavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engageme, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing likeindependence.  But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of myfriends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being.  We nevercould agree in our choice of a profession.  I always preferred thechurch, as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.They recommended the army.  That was a great deal too smart for me.The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who hadchambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the firstcircles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had noinclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, whichmy family approved.  As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but Iwas too old when the subject was first started to enter it--and, atlength, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all,as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back aswith one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageousand honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general soearnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of hisfriends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford and have beenproperly idle ever since.""The consequence of which, I suppose, will be," said Mrs. Dashwood,"since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons willbe brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and tradesas Columella's.""They will be brought up," said he, in a serious accent, "to be asunlike myself as is possible.  In feeling, in action, in condition, inevery thing.""Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlikeyourself must be happy.  But remember that the pain of parting fromfriends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be theireducation or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want nothing butpatience--or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope.  Yourmother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are soanxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become herhappiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.How much may not a few months do?""I think," replied Edward, "that I may defy many months to produce anygood to me."This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated toMrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, whichshortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor'sfeelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herselffrom appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on hisgoing away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed byMarianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, byseeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means were as differentas their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of thehouse, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought noravoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost asmuch as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by thisconduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least preventedfrom unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared muchsolicitude on her account.Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared nomore meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.The business of self-command she settled very easily;--with strongaffections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.That her sister's affections WERE calm, she dared not deny, though sheblushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she gave avery striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, inspite of this mortifying conviction.Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house indetermined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night toindulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enoughto think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every possiblevariety which the different state of her spirits at different timescould produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of hermother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude wasproduced.  Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could notbe chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject sointeresting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engrossher memory, her reflection, and her fancy.From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she wasroused one morning, soon after Edward's leaving them, by the arrival ofcompany.  She happened to be quite alone.  The closing of the littlegate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drewher eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to thedoor.  Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknownto her.  She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir Johnperceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony ofknocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to openthe casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between thedoor and the window, as to make it hardly possible to speak at onewithout being heard at the other."Well," said he, "we have brought you some strangers.  How do you likethem?""Hush! they will hear you.""Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.  Charlotte is verypretty, I can tell you.  You may see her if you look this way."As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, withouttaking that liberty, she begged to be excused."Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see herinstrument is open.""She is walking, I believe."They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough towait till the door was opened before she told HER story.  She camehallooing to the window, "How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs.Dashwood do?  And where are your sisters?  What! all alone! you will beglad of a little company to sit with you.  I have brought my other sonand daughter to see you.  Only think of their coming so suddenly!  Ithought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,but it never entered my head that it could be them.  I thought ofnothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; soI said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is ColonelBrandon come back again"--Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, toreceive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the twostrangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the sametime, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jenningscontinued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour,attended by Sir John.Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totallyunlike her in every respect.  She was short and plump, had a verypretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that couldpossibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister's,but they were much more prepossessing.  She came in with a smile,smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiledwhen she went away.  Her husband was a grave looking young man of fiveor six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife,but of less willingness to please or be pleased.  He entered the roomwith a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, withoutspeaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and theirapartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to readit as long as he staid.Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with aturn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before heradmiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth."Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything socharming!  Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last!I always thought it such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs.Dashwood) but you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister, howdelightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself!Should not you, Mr. Palmer?"Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from thenewspaper."Mr. Palmer does not hear me," said she, laughing; "he never doessometimes.  It is so ridiculous!"This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used tofind wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking withsurprise at them both.Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, andcontinued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeingtheir friends, without ceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmerlaughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and everybody agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite anagreeable surprise."You may believe how glad we all were to see them," added Mrs.Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voiceas if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated ondifferent sides of the room; "but, however, I can't help wishing theyhad not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,for they came all round by London upon account of some business, foryou know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it waswrong in her situation.  I wanted her to stay at home and rest thismorning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you all!"Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm."She expects to be confined in February," continued Mrs. Jennings.Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, andtherefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news inthe paper."No, none at all," he replied, and read on."Here comes Marianne," cried Sir John.  "Now, Palmer, you shall see amonstrous pretty girl."He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, andushered her in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as sheappeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed soheartily at the question, as to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmerlooked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, andthen returned to his newspaper.  Mrs. Palmer's eye was now caught bythe drawings which hung round the room.  She got up to examine them."Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!  Do butlook, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could lookat them for ever." And then sitting down again, she very soon forgotthat there were any such things in the room.When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid downthe newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around."My love, have you been asleep?" said his wife, laughing.He made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining theroom, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.He then made his bow, and departed with the rest.Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day atthe park.  Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftenerthan they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;her daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no curiosity tosee how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation ofpleasure from them in any other way.  They attempted, therefore,likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and notlikely to be good.  But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriageshould be sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too, thoughshe did not press their mother, pressed them.  Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.Palmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid afamily party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield."Why should they ask us?" said Marianne, as soon as they were gone."The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on veryhard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is stayingeither with them, or with us.""They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now," said Elinor, "bythese frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them afew weeks ago.  The alteration is not in them, if their parties aregrown tedious and dull.  We must look for the change elsewhere."As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the nextday, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking asgood humoured and merry as before.  She took them all mostaffectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing themagain."I am so glad to see you!" said she, seating herself between Elinor andMarianne, "for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We mustgo, for the Westons come to us next week you know.  It was quite asudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till thecarriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if Iwould go with him to Barton.  He is so droll! He never tells me anything! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet againin town very soon, I hope."They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation."Not go to town!" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, "I shall be quitedisappointed if you do not.  I could get the nicest house in the world foryou, next door to ours, in Hanover-square.  You must come, indeed.  Iam sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I amconfined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public."They thanked her; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties."Oh, my love," cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then enteredthe room--"you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go totown this winter."Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies, begancomplaining of the weather."How horrid all this is!" said he.  "Such weather makes every thing andevery body disgusting.  Dullness is as much produced within doors aswithout, by rain.  It makes one detest all one's acquaintance.  Whatthe devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in hishouse?  How few people know what comfort is!  Sir John is as stupid asthe weather."The rest of the company soon dropt in."I am afraid, Miss Marianne," said Sir John, "you have not been able totake your usual walk to Allenham today."Marianne looked very grave and said nothing."Oh, don't be so sly before us," said Mrs. Palmer; "for we know allabout it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I thinkhe is extremely handsome.  We do not live a great way from him in thecountry, you know.  Not above ten miles, I dare say.""Much nearer thirty," said her husband."Ah, well! there is not much difference.  I never was at his house; butthey say it is a sweet pretty place.""As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life," said Mr. Palmer.Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed herinterest in what was said."Is it very ugly?" continued Mrs. Palmer--"then it must be some otherplace that is so pretty I suppose."When they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with regretthat they were only eight all together."My dear," said he to his lady, "it is very provoking that we should beso few.  Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?""Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before,that it could not be done?  They dined with us last.""You and I, Sir John," said Mrs. Jennings, "should not stand upon suchceremony.""Then you would be very ill-bred," cried Mr. Palmer."My love you contradict every body," said his wife with her usuallaugh.  "Do you know that you are quite rude?""I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your motherill-bred.""Ay, you may abuse me as you please," said the good-natured old lady,"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back again.So there I have the whip hand of you."Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get ridof her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her,as they must live together.  It was impossible for any one to be morethoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of herhusband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she washighly diverted."Mr. Palmer is so droll!" said she, in a whisper, to Elinor.  "He isalways out of humour."Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him creditfor being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as hewished to appear.  His temper might perhaps be a little soured byfinding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountablebias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very sillywoman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for anysensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.-- It was rather a wish ofdistinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment ofevery body, and his general abuse of every thing before him.  It wasthe desire of appearing superior to other people.  The motive was toocommon to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed byestablishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attachany one to him except his wife."Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood," said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, "I havegot such a favour to ask of you and your sister.  Will you come andspend some time at Cleveland this Christmas?  Now, pray do,--and comewhile the Westons are with us.  You cannot think how happy I shall be!It will be quite delightful!--My love," applying to her husband, "don'tyou long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?""Certainly," he replied, with a sneer--"I came into Devonshire with noother view.""There now,"--said his lady, "you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so youcannot refuse to come."They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation."But indeed you must and shall come.  I am sure you will like it of allthings.  The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gaynow, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassingagainst the election; and so many people came to dine with us that Inever saw before, it is quite charming!  But, poor fellow! it is veryfatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him."Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to thehardship of such an obligation."How charming it will be," said Charlotte, "when he is inParliament!--won't it? How I shall laugh!  It will be so ridiculous tosee all his letters directed to him with an M.P.--But do you know, hesays, he will never frank for me?  He declares he won't.  Don't you,Mr. Palmer?"Mr. Palmer took no notice of her."He cannot bear writing, you know," she continued--"he says it is quiteshocking.""No," said he, "I never said any thing so irrational.  Don't palm allyour abuses of languages upon me.""There now; you see how droll he is.  This is always the way with him!Sometimes he won't speak to me for half a day together, and then hecomes out with something so droll--all about any thing in the world."She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively."Certainly," said Elinor; "he seems very agreeable.""Well--I am so glad you do.  I thought you would, he is so pleasant;and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I cantell you, and you can't think how disappointed he will be if you don'tcome to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object to it."Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing thesubject, put a stop to her entreaties.  She thought it probable that asthey lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give somemore particular account of Willoughby's general character, than couldbe gathered from the Middletons' partial acquaintance with him; and shewas eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his merits asmight remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She began byinquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whetherthey were intimately acquainted with him."Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well," replied Mrs. Palmer;--"Notthat I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he wasat Allenham.  Mama saw him here once before;--but I was with my uncleat Weymouth.  However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal ofhim in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that weshould never have been in the country together.  He is very little atCombe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr.Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, andbesides it is such a way off.  I know why you inquire about him, verywell; your sister is to marry him.  I am monstrous glad of it, for thenI shall have her for a neighbour you know.""Upon my word," replied Elinor, "you know much more of the matter thanI do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.""Don't pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talksof.  I assure you I heard of it in my way through town.""My dear Mrs. Palmer!""Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning inBond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly.""You surprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell you of it!  Surelyyou must be mistaken.  To give such intelligence to a person who couldnot be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I shouldexpect Colonel Brandon to do.""But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you howit happened.  When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; andso we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing andanother, and I said to him, 'So, Colonel, there is a new family come toBarton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty,and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of CombeMagna.  Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have beenin Devonshire so lately.'""And what did the Colonel say?""Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true, sofrom that moment I set it down as certain.  It will be quitedelightful, I declare!  When is it to take place?""Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?""Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing butsay fine things of you.""I am flattered by his commendation.  He seems an excellent man; and Ithink him uncommonly pleasing.""So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he shouldbe so grave and so dull.  Mama says HE was in love with your sistertoo.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardlyever falls in love with any body.""Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?" saidElinor."Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people areacquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they allthink him extremely agreeable I assure you.  Nobody is more liked thanMr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.  Sheis a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that heis much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome andagreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her.  However, I don'tthink her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I thinkyou both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,though we could not get him to own it last night."Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby was not very material;but any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her."I am so glad we are got acquainted at last," continuedCharlotte.--"And now I hope we shall always be great friends.  Youcan't think how much I longed to see you!  It is so delightful that youshould live at the cottage!  Nothing can be like it, to be sure!  And Iam so glad your sister is going to be well married!  I hope you will bea great deal at Combe Magna.  It is a sweet place, by all accounts.""You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?""Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.-- He was aparticular friend of Sir John's. I believe," she added in a low voice,"he would have been very glad to have had me, if he could.  Sir Johnand Lady Middleton wished it very much.  But mama did not think thematch good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it tothe Colonel, and we should have been married immediately.""Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John's proposal to your motherbefore it was made?  Had he never owned his affection to yourself?""Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would haveliked it of all things.  He had not seen me then above twice, for itwas before I left school.  However, I am much happier as I am.  Mr.Palmer is the kind of man I like."The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families atBarton were again left to entertain each other.  But this did not lastlong; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head, hadhardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause, atMr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strangeunsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before SirJohn's and Mrs. Jennings's active zeal in the cause of society,procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe.In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies,whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be herrelations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly tothe park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such aninvitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on thereturn of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive avisit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whoseelegance,--whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof; forthe assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went fornothing at all.  Their being her relations too made it so much theworse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were thereforeunfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care abouttheir being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must putup with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to preventtheir coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, withall the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merelygiving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six timesevery day.The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel orunfashionable.  Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil,they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that LadyMiddleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they hadbeen an hour at the Park.  She declared them to be very agreeable girlsindeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.  Sir John'sconfidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and heset off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the MissSteeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girlsin the world.  From such commendation as this, however, there was notmuch to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in theworld were to be met with in every part of England, under everypossible variation of form, face, temper and understanding.  Sir Johnwanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at hisguests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!  It was painful to him even tokeep a third cousin to himself."Do come now," said he--"pray come--you must come--I declare you shallcome--You can't think how you will like them.  Lucy is monstrouspretty, and so good humoured and agreeable!  The children are allhanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance.  And theyboth long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter thatyou are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told themit is all very true, and a great deal more.  You will be delighted withthem I am sure.  They have brought the whole coach full of playthingsfor the children.  How can you be so cross as not to come?  Why theyare your cousins, you know, after a fashion.  YOU are my cousins, andthey are my wife's, so you must be related."But Sir John could not prevail.  He could only obtain a promise oftheir calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them inamazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of theirattractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of theMiss Steeles to them.When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction tothese young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of theeldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensibleface, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two orthree and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her featureswere pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air,which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinctionto her person.-- Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soonallowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with whatconstant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeableto Lady Middleton.  With her children they were in continual raptures,extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring theirwhims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunatedemands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration ofwhatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing,or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which herappearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fondmother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the mostrapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demandsare exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessiveaffection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring wereviewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise ordistrust.  She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinentencroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, theirwork-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and feltno doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no othersurprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,without claiming a share in what was passing."John is in such spirits today!" said she, on his taking Miss Steeles'spocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window--"He is full ofmonkey tricks."And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently pinching one of thesame lady's fingers, she fondly observed, "How playful William is!""And here is my sweet little Annamaria," she added, tenderly caressinga little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the lasttwo minutes; "And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was theresuch a quiet little thing!"But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship'shead dress slightly scratching the child's neck, produced from thispattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdoneby any creature professedly noisy.  The mother's consternation wasexcessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, andevery thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, whichaffection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the littlesufferer.  She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses, herwound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who wason her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums bythe other.  With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise tocease crying.  She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her twobrothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings wereineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene ofsimilar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had beensuccessfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerlyproposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission ofscreams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope thatit would not be rejected.-- She was carried out of the room thereforein her mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boyschose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to staybehind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the roomhad not known for many hours."Poor little creatures!" said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone."It might have been a very sad accident.""Yet I hardly know how," cried Marianne, "unless it had been undertotally different circumstances.  But this is the usual way ofheightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality.""What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!" said Lucy Steele.Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did notfeel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the wholetask of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell.  She didher best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton with morewarmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy."And Sir John too," cried the elder sister, "what a charming man he is!"Here too, Miss Dashwood's commendation, being only simple and just,came in without any eclat.  She merely observed that he was perfectlygood humoured and friendly."And what a charming little family they have!  I never saw such finechildren in my life.--I declare I quite doat upon them already, andindeed I am always distractedly fond of children.""I should guess so," said Elinor, with a smile, "from what I havewitnessed this morning.""I have a notion," said Lucy, "you think the little Middletons rathertoo much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it isso natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see childrenfull of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame andquiet.""I confess," replied Elinor, "that while I am at Barton Park, I neverthink of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence."A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by MissSteele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who nowsaid rather abruptly, "And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex."In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least ofthe manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was."Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?" added Miss Steele."We have heard Sir John admire it excessively," said Lucy, who seemedto think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister."I think every one MUST admire it," replied Elinor, "who ever saw theplace; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate itsbeauties as we do.""And had you a great many smart beaux there?  I suppose you have not somany in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vastaddition always.""But why should you think," said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister,"that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex?""Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to say that there an't.  I'msure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how couldI tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was onlyafraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had notso many as they used to have.  But perhaps you young ladies may notcare about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with them.For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they dresssmart and behave civil.  But I can't bear to see them dirty and nasty.Now there's Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man, quite abeau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but meet him ofa morning, he is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was quitea beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was so rich?""Upon my word," replied Elinor, "I cannot tell you, for I do notperfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.  But this I can say, thatif he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there isnot the smallest alteration in him.""Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men's being beaux--they havesomething else to do.""Lord! Anne," cried her sister, "you can talk of nothing butbeaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else."And then to turn the discourse, she began admiring the house and thefurniture.This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.  The vulgar freedom andfolly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was notblinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her wantof real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wishof knowing them better.Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well provided withadmiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all hisrelations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his faircousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whomthey were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to bebetter acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitablelot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind ofintimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or twotogether in the same room almost every day.  Sir John could do no more;but he did not know that any more was required: to be together was, inhis opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for theirmeeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being establishedfriends.To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote theirunreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knewor supposed of his cousins' situations in the most delicateparticulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before theeldest of them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky asto make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton."'Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure," saidshe, "and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome.  And Ihope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may havea friend in the corner already."Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice inproclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had beenwith respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke ofthe two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and sinceEdward's visit, they had never dined together without his drinking toher best affections with so much significancy and so many nods andwinks, as to excite general attention.  The letter F--had been likewiseinvariably brought forward, and found productive of such countlessjokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet hadbeen long established with Elinor.The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of thesejokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know thename of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinentlyexpressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitivenessinto the concerns of their family.  But Sir John did not sport longwith the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least asmuch pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it."His name is Ferrars," said he, in a very audible whisper; "but pray donot tell it, for it's a great secret.""Ferrars!" repeated Miss Steele; "Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he?What! your sister-in-law's brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeableyoung man to be sure; I know him very well.""How can you say so, Anne?" cried Lucy, who generally made an amendmentto all her sister's assertions.  "Though we have seen him once or twiceat my uncle's, it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well."Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise.  "And who was thisuncle?  Where did he live?  How came they acquainted?"  She wished verymuch to have the subject continued, though she did not chuse to join init herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time inher life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity afterpetty information, or in a disposition to communicate it.  The mannerin which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; forit struck her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicionof that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to know something to hisdisadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing, for no farther noticewas taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by Miss Steele when alluded to, or evenopenly mentioned by Sir John.Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing likeimpertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference oftaste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, fromthe state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or toencourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of herbehaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy ontheir side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herselfwhich soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially ofLucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation, or ofstriving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frankcommunication of her sentiments.Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often just and amusing; andas a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable;but her powers had received no aid from education: she was ignorant andilliterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement, her want ofinformation in the most common particulars, could not be concealed fromMiss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to appear toadvantage.  Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of abilitieswhich education might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, withless tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, ofrectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, herassiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have nolasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insinceritywith ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting inconversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others madeevery shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectlyvalueless."You will think my question an odd one, I dare say," said Lucy to herone day, as they were walking together from the park to thecottage--"but pray, are you personally acquainted with yoursister-in-law's mother, Mrs. Ferrars?"Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her countenanceexpressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars."Indeed!" replied Lucy; "I wonder at that, for I thought you must haveseen her at Norland sometimes.  Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me whatsort of a woman she is?""No," returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward'smother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinentcuriosity-- "I know nothing of her.""I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such away," said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; "but perhapsthere may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I hope youwill do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to beimpertinent."Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes insilence.  It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again bysaying, with some hesitation,"I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious.  I am sure Iwould rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a personwhose good opinion is so well worth having as yours.  And I am sure Ishould not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should bevery glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortablesituation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU.I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.""I am sorry I do NOT," said Elinor, in great astonishment, "if it couldbe of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her.  But really I neverunderstood that you were at all connected with that family, andtherefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiryinto her character.""I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it.  Butif I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised.  Mrs.Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present--but the time MAYcome--how soon it will come must depend upon herself--when we may bevery intimately connected."She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one sideglance at her companion to observe its effect on her."Good heavens!" cried Elinor, "what do you mean?  Are you acquaintedwith Mr. Robert Ferrars?  Can you be?" And she did not feel muchdelighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law."No," replied Lucy, "not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I never saw him in mylife; but," fixing her eyes upon Elinor, "to his eldest brother."What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been aspainful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of theassertion attended it.  She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and thoughher complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt in nodanger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon."You may well be surprised," continued Lucy; "for to be sure you couldhave had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped thesmallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was alwaysmeant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept soby me to this hour.  Not a soul of all my relations know of it butAnne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not feltthe greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I reallythought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrarsmust seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.  And I do not thinkMr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you,because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all yourfamily, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite ashis own sisters."--She paused.Elinor for a few moments remained silent.  Her astonishment at what sheheard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herselfto speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude-- "May I askif your engagement is of long standing?""We have been engaged these four years.""Four years!""Yes."Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it."I did not know," said she, "that you were even acquainted till theother day.""Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.  He was under myuncle's care, you know, a considerable while.""Your uncle!""Yes; Mr. Pratt.  Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?""I think I have," replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, whichincreased with her increase of emotion."He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, nearPlymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and mewas often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement wasformed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but hewas almost always with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enterinto it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation ofhis mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be soprudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so wellas me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensiblehe is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.""Certainly," answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but aftera moment's reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward'shonour and love, and her companion's falsehood--"Engaged to Mr. EdwardFerrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,that really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistakeof person or name.  We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.""We can mean no other," cried Lucy, smiling.  "Mr. Edward Ferrars, theeldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of yoursister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allowthat I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on whoall my happiness depends.""It is strange," replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, "that Ishould never have heard him even mention your name.""No; considering our situation, it was not strange.  Our first care hasbeen to keep the matter secret.-- You knew nothing of me, or my family,and, therefore, there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my nameto you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister'ssuspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it."She was silent.--Elinor's security sunk; but her self-command did notsink with it."Four years you have been engaged," said she with a firm voice."Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait.  PoorEdward!  It puts him quite out of heart." Then taking a small miniaturefrom her pocket, she added, "To prevent the possibility of mistake, beso good as to look at this face.  It does not do him justice, to besure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it wasdrew for.--I have had it above these three years."She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw thepainting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, orher wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind, shecould have none of its being Edward's face.  She returned it almostinstantly, acknowledging the likeness."I have never been able," continued Lucy, "to give him my picture inreturn, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always soanxious to get it!  But I am determined to set for it the very firstopportunity.""You are quite in the right," replied Elinor calmly.  They thenproceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first."I am sure," said she, "I have no doubt in the world of your faithfullykeeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is tous, not to have it reach his mother; for she would never approve of it,I dare say.  I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceedingproud woman.""I certainly did not seek your confidence," said Elinor; "but you do meno more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on.  Yoursecret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at sounnecessary a communication.  You must at least have felt that my beingacquainted with it could not add to its safety."As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discoversomething in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatestpart of what she had been saying; but Lucy's countenance suffered nochange."I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,"said she, "in telling you all this.  I have not known you long to besure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family bydescription a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost asif you was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case, I reallythought some explanation was due to you after my making such particularinquiries about Edward's mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I havenot a creature whose advice I can ask.  Anne is the only person thatknows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me agreat deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of herbetraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you mustperceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the worldt'other day, when Edward's name was mentioned by Sir John, lest sheshould out with it all.  You can't think how much I go through in mymind from it altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what Ihave suffered for Edward's sake these last four years.  Every thing insuch suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom--we can hardlymeet above twice a-year.  I am sure I wonder my heart is not quitebroke."Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel verycompassionate."Sometimes." continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, "I think whether itwould not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely."  Asshe said this, she looked directly at her companion.  "But then atother times I have not resolution enough for it.-- I cannot bear thethoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of sucha thing would do.  And on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--Idon't think I could be equal to it.  What would you advise me to do insuch a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you do yourself?""Pardon me," replied Elinor, startled by the question; "but I can giveyou no advice under such circumstances.  Your own judgment must directyou.""To be sure," continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on bothsides, "his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poorEdward is so cast down by it!  Did you not think him dreadfullow-spirited when he was at Barton?  He was so miserable when he leftus at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think himquite ill.""Did he come from your uncle's, then, when he visited us?""Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.  Did you think hecame directly from town?""No," replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every freshcircumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity; "I remember he told us, thathe had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth." Sheremembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothingfarther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even totheir names."Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?" repeated Lucy."We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.""I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was thematter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more thana fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--Iam afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes in wretchedspirits.  I heard from him just before I left Exeter;" taking a letterfrom her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.  "Youknow his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but that is notwritten so well as usual.--He was tired, I dare say, for he had justfilled the sheet to me as full as possible."Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt no longer.  Thispicture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have beenaccidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward's gift; but acorrespondence between them by letter, could subsist only under apositive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a fewmoments, she was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and shecould hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and shestruggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, thather success was speedy, and for the time complete."Writing to each other," said Lucy, returning the letter into herpocket, "is the only comfort we have in such long separations.  Yes, Ihave one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not evenTHAT.  If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.  I gave hima lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last, andthat was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture.Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?""I did," said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which wasconcealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever feltbefore.  She was mortified, shocked, confounded.Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and theconversation could be continued no farther.  After sitting with them afew minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was thenat liberty to think and be wretched.[At this point in the first and second editions, Volume 1 ends.]However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be,it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in thepresent case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly ofinventing a falsehood of such a description.  What Lucy had asserted tobe true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supportedas it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, andcontradicted by nothing but her own wishes.  Their opportunity ofacquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest,at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit near Plymouth,his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects,his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of theMiss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which hadoften surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formedaltogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear ofcondemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partialitycould set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--Her resentment of suchbehaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short timemade her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations,soon arose.  Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?  Had hefeigned a regard for her which he did not feel?  Was his engagement toLucy an engagement of the heart?  No; whatever it might once have been,she could not believe it such at present.  His affection was all herown.  She could not be deceived in that.  Her mother, sisters, Fanny,all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not anillusion of her own vanity.  He certainly loved her.  What a softenerof the heart was this persuasion!  How much could it not tempt her toforgive!  He had been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining atNorland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than itought to be.  In that, he could not be defended; but if he had injuredher, how much more had he injured himself; if her case were pitiable,his was hopeless.  His imprudence had made her miserable for a while;but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever beingotherwise.  She might in time regain tranquillity; but HE, what had heto look forward to?  Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele;could he, were his affection for herself out of the question, with hisintegrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with awife like her--illiterate, artful, and selfish?The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to everything but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeedingyears--years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to theunderstanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education,while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior societyand more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicitywhich might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficultiesfrom his mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likelyto be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior inconnections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.  Thesedifficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might notpress very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was the state of theperson by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness,could be felt as a relief!As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she weptfor him, more than for herself.  Supported by the conviction of havingdone nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by thebelief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she thoughtshe could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, commandherself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her motherand sisters.  And so well was she able to answer her own expectations,that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had firstsuffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would havesupposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourningin secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the objectof her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on theperfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughlypossessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drovenear their house.The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had beenentrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to unceasingexertion, was no aggravation of Elinor's distress.  On the contrary itwas a relief to her, to be spared the communication of what would givesuch affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing thatcondemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess oftheir partial affection for herself, and which was more than she feltequal to support.From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receiveno assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress,while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from theirexample nor from their praise.  She was stronger alone, and her owngood sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken,her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets sopoignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on thesubject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this formore reasons than one.  She wanted to hear many particulars of theirengagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand whatLucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in herdeclaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted toconvince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and hercalmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested init than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntaryagitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at leastdoubtful.  That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared veryprobable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in herpraise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing totrust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret soconfessedly and evidently important.  And even Sir John's jokingintelligence must have had some weight.  But indeed, while Elinorremained so well assured within herself of being really beloved byEdward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make itnatural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her veryconfidence was a proof.  What other reason for the disclosure of theaffair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it ofLucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future?She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival'sintentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as everyprinciple of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affectionfor Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not denyherself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart wasunwounded.  And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear onthe subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her ownability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could becommanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to takeadvantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fineenough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might mosteasily separate themselves from the others; and though they met atleast every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly atthe former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake ofconversation.  Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or LadyMiddleton's head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given fora general chat, and none at all for particular discourse.  They met forthe sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affordingElinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called atthe cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that theywould all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged toattend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone,except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.  Elinor, who foresaw afairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as thiswas likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquiland well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband unitedthem together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted theinvitation; Margaret, with her mother's permission, was equallycompliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of theirparties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have herseclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved fromthe frightful solitude which had threatened her.  The insipidity of themeeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not onenovelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interestingthan the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour anddrawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and whilethey remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility ofengaging Lucy's attention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with theremoval of the tea-things.  The card-table was then placed, and Elinorbegan to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope offinding time for conversation at the park.  They all rose up inpreparation for a round game."I am glad," said Lady Middleton to Lucy, "you are not going to finishpoor little Annamaria's basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurtyour eyes to work filigree by candlelight.  And we will make the dearlittle love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then Ihope she will not much mind it."This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,"Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waitingto know whether you can make your party without me, or I should havebeen at my filigree already.  I would not disappoint the little angelfor all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I amresolved to finish the basket after supper.""You are very good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes--will you ring thebell for some working candles?  My poor little girl would be sadlydisappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, forthough I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends uponhaving it done."Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with analacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste nogreater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others.  No one madeany objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the formsof general civility, exclaimed, "Your Ladyship will have the goodnessto excuse ME--you know I detest cards.  I shall go to the piano-forte;I have not touched it since it was tuned."  And without fartherceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never madeso rude a speech."Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma'am,"said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; "and I do notmuch wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I everheard."The remaining five were now to draw their cards."Perhaps," continued Elinor, "if I should happen to cut out, I may beof some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; andthere is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must beimpossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.  Ishould like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in it.""Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help," cried Lucy,"for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was;and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria afterall.""Oh! that would be terrible, indeed," said Miss Steele-- "Dear littlesoul, how I do love her!""You are very kind," said Lady Middleton to Elinor; "and as you reallylike the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in tillanother rubber, or will you take your chance now?"Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by alittle of that address which Marianne could never condescend topractise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the sametime.  Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fairrivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with theutmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.  The pianoforte atwhich Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, hadby this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she mightsafely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interestingsubject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began."I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on itssubject.  I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.""Thank you," cried Lucy warmly, "for breaking the ice; you have set myheart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offendedyou by what I told you that Monday.""Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me," and Elinor spokeit with the truest sincerity, "nothing could be farther from myintention than to give you such an idea.  Could you have a motive forthe trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?""And yet I do assure you," replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full ofmeaning, "there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in yourmanner that made me quite uncomfortable.  I felt sure that you wasangry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, forhaving took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.  But I amvery glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do notblame me.  If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve myheart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment ofmy life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I amsure.""Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shallnever have reason to repent it.  Your case is a very unfortunate one;you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will haveneed of all your mutual affection to support you under them.  Mr.Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.""He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness tomarry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospectof more without a sigh.  I have been always used to a very smallincome, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him toowell to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that hismother might give him if he married to please her.  We must wait, itmay be for many years.  With almost every other man in the world, itwould be an alarming prospect; but Edward's affection and constancynothing can deprive me of I know.""That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedlysupported by the same trust in your's.  If the strength of yourreciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and undermany circumstances it naturally would during a four years' engagement,your situation would have been pitiable, indeed."Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenancefrom every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency."Edward's love for me," said Lucy, "has been pretty well put to thetest, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, andit has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubtit now.  I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's alarmon that account from the first."Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.Lucy went on.  "I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and fromour different situations in life, from his being so much more in theworld than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined forsuspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had beenthe slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or anylowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had talkedmore of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less happy atLongstaple than he used to be.  I do not mean to say that I amparticularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a caseI am sure I could not be deceived.""All this," thought Elinor, "is very pretty; but it can impose uponneither of us.""But what," said she after a short silence, "are your views? or haveyou none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is amelancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit tothis, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in whichit may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure for awhile by owning the truth?""If we could be certain that it would be only for a while!  But Mrs.Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of angerupon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert, andthe idea of that, for Edward's sake, frightens away all my inclinationfor hasty measures.""And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestednessbeyond reason."Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent."Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?" asked Elinor."Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike hisbrother--silly and a great coxcomb.""A great coxcomb!" repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught thosewords by a sudden pause in Marianne's music.-- "Oh, they are talking oftheir favourite beaux, I dare say.""No sister," cried Lucy, "you are mistaken there, our favourite beauxare NOT great coxcombs.""I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's is not," said Mrs. Jennings,laughing heartily; "for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behavedyoung men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly littlecreature, there is no finding out who SHE likes.""Oh," cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, "I daresay Lucy's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as MissDashwood's."Elinor blushed in spite of herself.  Lucy bit her lip, and lookedangrily at her sister.  A mutual silence took place for some time.Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Mariannewas then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificentconcerto--"I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into myhead, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you intothe secret, for you are a party concerned.  I dare say you have seenenough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every otherprofession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as hecan, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be kindenough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some regardto me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living;which I understand is a very good one, and the present incumbent notlikely to live a great while.  That would be enough for us to marryupon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest.""I should always be happy," replied Elinor, "to show any mark of myesteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that myinterest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  He isbrother to Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough toher husband.""But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward's going intoorders.""Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little."They were again silent for many minutes.  At length Lucy exclaimed witha deep sigh,"I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business atonce by dissolving the engagement.  We seem so beset with difficultieson every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, weshould be happier perhaps in the end.  But you will not give me youradvice, Miss Dashwood?""No," answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitatedfeelings, "on such a subject I certainly will not.  You know very wellthat my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on theside of your wishes.""Indeed you wrong me," replied Lucy, with great solemnity; "I knownobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I doreally believe, that if you was to say to me, 'I advise you by allmeans to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will bemore for the happiness of both of you,' I should resolve upon doing itimmediately."Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward's future wife, andreplied, "This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving anyopinion on the subject had I formed one.  It raises my influence muchtoo high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is toomuch for an indifferent person.""'Tis because you are an indifferent person," said Lucy, with somepique, and laying a particular stress on those words, "that yourjudgment might justly have such weight with me.  If you could besupposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your opinionwould not be worth having."Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they mightprovoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve; andwas even partly determined never to mention the subject again.  Anotherpause therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this speech, andLucy was still the first to end it."Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?" said she with allher accustomary complacency."Certainly not.""I am sorry for that," returned the other, while her eyes brightened atthe information, "it would have gave me such pleasure to meet youthere!  But I dare say you will go for all that.  To be sure, yourbrother and sister will ask you to come to them.""It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do.""How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there.Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations whohave been wanting us to visit them these several years!  But I only gofor the sake of seeing Edward.  He will be there in February, otherwiseLondon would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it."Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the firstrubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was thereforeat an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, fornothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each otherless than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card tablewith the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only withoutaffection for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had noteven the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which sincereaffection on HER side would have given, for self-interest alone couldinduce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which she seemed sothoroughly aware that he was weary.From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and whenentered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it,and was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her happinesswhenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated by theformer with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as civilitywould allow; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence whichLucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyondwhat the first invitation implied.  Their favour increased; they couldnot be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite oftheir numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of theabsolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which wasin full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to staynearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration ofthat festival which requires a more than ordinary share of privateballs and large dinners to proclaim its importance.Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion ofthe year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not withouta settled habitation of her own.  Since the death of her husband, whohad traded with success in a less elegant part of the town, she hadresided every winter in a house in one of the streets near PortmanSquare.  Towards this home, she began on the approach of January toturn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and veryunexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her.Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her sister, and theanimated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gavea grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she believed herselfto be speaking their united inclinations.  The reason alleged was theirdetermined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of theyear.  Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise, andrepeated her invitation immediately."Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I DO begyou will favour me with your company, for I've quite set my heart uponit.  Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I shan'tput myself at all out of my way for you.  It will only be sending Bettyby the coach, and I hope I can afford THAT.  We three shall be able togo very well in my chaise; and when we are in town, if you do not liketo go wherever I do, well and good, you may always go with one of mydaughters.  I am sure your mother will not object to it; for I have hadsuch good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she willthink me a very fit person to have the charge of you; and if I don'tget one of you at least well married before I have done with you, itshall not be my fault.  I shall speak a good word for you to all theyoung men, you may depend upon it.""I have a notion," said Sir John, "that Miss Marianne would not objectto such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it.  It is veryhard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because MissDashwood does not wish it.  So I would advise you two, to set off fortown, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to MissDashwood about it.""Nay," cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure I shall be monstrous glad ofMiss Marianne's company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only themore the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable forthem to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talkto one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.  But one orthe other, if not both of them, I must have.  Lord bless me! how do youthink I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used tillthis winter to have Charlotte with me.  Come, Miss Marianne, let usstrike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change hermind by and bye, why so much the better.""I thank you, ma'am, sincerely thank you," said Marianne, with warmth:"your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would giveme such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,to be able to accept it.  But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--Ifeel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be madeless happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no, nothing shouldtempt me to leave her.  It should not, must not be a struggle."Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could sparethem perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and sawto what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by hereagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther directopposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother'sdecision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive anysupport in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could notapprove of for Marianne, and which on her own account she hadparticular reasons to avoid.  Whatever Marianne was desirous of, hermother would be eager to promote--she could not expect to influence thelatter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she hadnever been able to inspire her with distrust; and she dared not explainthe motive of her own disinclination for going to London.  ThatMarianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.Jennings' manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlookevery inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must bemost wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object,was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that objectto her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared towitness.On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that suchan excursion would be productive of much amusement to both herdaughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention toherself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear oftheir declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on their bothaccepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usualcheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,from this separation."I am delighted with the plan," she cried, "it is exactly what I couldwish.  Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly andhappily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaretso improved when you come back again!  I have a little plan ofalteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed withoutany inconvenience to any one.  It is very right that you SHOULD go totown; I would have every young woman of your condition in lifeacquainted with the manners and amusements of London.  You will beunder the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness toyou I can have no doubt.  And in all probability you will see yourbrother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so whollyestranged from each other.""Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness," said Elinor, "youhave been obviating every impediment to the present scheme whichoccurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,cannot be so easily removed."Marianne's countenance sunk."And what," said Mrs. Dashwood, "is my dear prudent Elinor going tosuggest?  What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?  Do letme hear a word about the expense of it.""My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings'sheart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, orwhose protection will give us consequence.""That is very true," replied her mother, "but of her society,separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thingat all, and you will almost always appear in public with LadyMiddleton.""If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings," saidMarianne, "at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation.  Ihave no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with everyunpleasantness of that kind with very little effort."Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towardsthe manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty inpersuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolvedwithin herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would golikewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be leftto the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings shouldbe abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of herdomestic hours.  To this determination she was the more easilyreconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account, wasnot to be in town before February; and that their visit, without anyunreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished."I will have you BOTH go," said Mrs. Dashwood; "these objections arenonsensical.  You will have much pleasure in being in London, andespecially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend toanticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety ofsources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving heracquaintance with her sister-in-law's family."Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken hermother's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that theshock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on thisattack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to beginher design by saying, as calmly as she could, "I like Edward Ferrarsvery much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest ofthe family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, whether I amever known to them or not."Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.  Marianne lifted up her eyes inastonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have heldher tongue.After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that theinvitation should be fully accepted.  Mrs. Jennings received theinformation with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindnessand care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her.  Sir John wasdelighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread ofbeing alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants inLondon, was something.  Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of beingdelighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way; and as forthe Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy intheir lives as this intelligence made them.Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes withless reluctance than she had expected to feel.  With regard to herself,it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, andwhen she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and hersister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to allher usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, shecould not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allowherself to distrust the consequence.Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was theperturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone.  Herunwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness;and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one ofthe three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short ofeternal.Their departure took place in the first week in January.  TheMiddletons were to follow in about a week.  The Miss Steeles kept theirstation at the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of thefamily.Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, andbeginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest,without wondering at her own situation, so short had their acquaintancewith that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age anddisposition, and so many had been her objections against such a measureonly a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happyardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared, beenovercome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubtof Willoughby's constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightfulexpectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes ofMarianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect, how cheerlessher own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she wouldengage in the solicitude of Marianne's situation to have the sameanimating object in view, the same possibility of hope.  A short, avery short time however must now decide what Willoughby's intentionswere; in all probability he was already in town.  Marianne's eagernessto be gone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor wasresolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his characterwhich her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with suchzealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant,before many meetings had taken place.  Should the result of herobservations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to openthe eyes of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions would beof a different nature--she must then learn to avoid every selfishcomparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfactionin the happiness of Marianne.They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as theytravelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance andcompanionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be.  She sat insilence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcelyever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beautywithin their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusivelyaddressed to her sister.  To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinortook immediate possession of the post of civility which she hadassigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever shecould; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with allpossible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease andenjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose theirown dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferringsalmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.  They reached town bythree o'clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey,from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxuryof a good fire.The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladieswere immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment.  Ithad formerly been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung alandscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of her havingspent seven years at a great school in town to some effect.As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from theirarrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to hermother, and sat down for that purpose.  In a few moments Marianne didthe same.  "I am writing home, Marianne," said Elinor; "had not youbetter defer your letter for a day or two?""I am NOT going to write to my mother," replied Marianne, hastily, andas if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; itimmediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby; andthe conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, howevermysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must beengaged.  This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave herpleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be nomore than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed witheager rapidity.  Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in thedirection; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing thebell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyedfor her to the two-penny post.  This decided the matter at once.Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in themwhich prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and thisagitation increased as the evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat anydinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemedanxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being muchengaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing.  The teathings were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed morethan once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenlyheard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinorfelt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach, and Marianne,starting up, moved towards the door.  Every thing was silent; thiscould not be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a fewsteps towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returnedinto the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heardhim would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at thatinstant she could not help exclaiming, "Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby,indeed it is!" and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms,when Colonel Brandon appeared.It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediatelyleft the room.  Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time herregard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her; and she feltparticularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceivethat she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeinghim.  She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he evenobserved Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment andconcern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demandedtowards herself."Is your sister ill?" said he.Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked ofhead-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to whichshe could decently attribute her sister's behaviour.He heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollecthimself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak ofhis pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries abouttheir journey, and the friends they had left behind.In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughtsof both engaged elsewhere.  Elinor wished very much to ask whetherWilloughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain byany enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying something,she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last."Yes," he replied, with some embarrassment, "almost ever since; I havebeen once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been inmy power to return to Barton."This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back toher remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, withthe uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and shewas fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on thesubject than she had ever felt.Mrs. Jennings soon came in.  "Oh! Colonel," said she, with her usualnoisy cheerfulness, "I am monstrous glad to see you--sorry I could notcome before--beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me alittle, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have beenat home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to doafter one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright tosettle with-- Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in towntoday?""I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer's, where I have beendining.""Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house?  How doesCharlotte do?  I warrant you she is a fine size by this time.""Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,that you will certainly see her to-morrow.""Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.  Well, Colonel, I have brought twoyoung ladies with me, you see--that is, you see but one of them now,but there is another somewhere.  Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--whichyou will not be sorry to hear.  I do not know what you and Mr.Willoughby will do between you about her.  Ay, it is a fine thing to beyoung and handsome.  Well! I was young once, but I never was veryhandsome--worse luck for me.  However, I got a very good husband, and Idon't know what the greatest beauty can do more.  Ah! poor man! he hasbeen dead these eight years and better.  But Colonel, where have youbeen to since we parted?  And how does your business go on?  Come,come, let's have no secrets among friends."He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, butwithout satisfying her in any.  Elinor now began to make the tea, andMarianne was obliged to appear again.After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silentthan he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him tostay long.  No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies wereunanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in theexpectation of what was to happen that day.  They had not long finishedtheir breakfast before Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, andin a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to seethem all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasurefrom meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again.  So surprised attheir coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected allalong; so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation after havingdeclined her own, though at the same time she would never have forgiventhem if they had not come!"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you," said she; "What do you thinkhe said when he heard of your coming with Mama?  I forget what it wasnow, but it was something so droll!"After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all theiracquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side, and in laughter without cause onMrs. Palmer's, it was proposed by the latter that they should allaccompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, towhich Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewisesome purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it atfirst was induced to go likewise.Wherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch.  In BondStreet especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were inconstant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mindwas equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from allthat interested and occupied the others.  Restless and dissatisfiedevery where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of any articleof purchase, however it might equally concern them both: she receivedno pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at home again, andcould with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs.Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing pretty, expensive, or new;who was wild to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away hertime in rapture and indecision.It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner hadthey entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and whenElinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a sorrowfulcountenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there."Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?" said she tothe footman who then entered with the parcels.  She was answered in thenegative.  "Are you quite sure of it?" she replied.  "Are you certainthat no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?"The man replied that none had."How very odd!" said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as sheturned away to the window."How odd, indeed!" repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her sisterwith uneasiness.  "If she had not known him to be in town she would nothave written to him, as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come nor write!Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagementbetween a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on inso doubtful, so mysterious a manner!  I long to inquire; and how willMY interference be borne."She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continuedmany days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would represent inthe strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some seriousenquiry into the affair.Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's intimateacquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined withthem.  The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her eveningengagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist tablefor the others.  Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as shewould never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at herown disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasureto her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety ofexpectation and the pain of disappointment.  She sometimes endeavouredfor a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and shereturned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards andforwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to thewindow, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap."If this open weather holds much longer," said Mrs. Jennings, when theymet at breakfast the following morning, "Sir John will not like leavingBarton next week; 'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day'spleasure.  Poor souls!  I always pity them when they do; they seem totake it so much to heart.""That is true," cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to thewindow as she spoke, to examine the day.  "I had not thought of that.This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country."It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it."It is charming weather for THEM indeed," she continued, as she satdown to the breakfast table with a happy countenance.  "How much theymust enjoy it! But" (with a little return of anxiety) "it cannot beexpected to last long.  At this time of the year, and after such aseries of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it.  Frostswill soon set in, and in all probability with severity.  In another dayor two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer--nay,perhaps it may freeze tonight!""At any rate," said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings fromseeing her sister's thoughts as clearly as she did, "I dare say weshall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week.""Ay, my dear, I'll warrant you we do.  Mary always has her own way.""And now," silently conjectured Elinor, "she will write to Combe bythis day's post."But if she DID, the letter was written and sent away with a privacywhich eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact.  Whatever thetruth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thoroughcontentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she couldnot be very uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits; happyin the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation ofa frost.The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.Jennings's acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; andMarianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in theair."Don't you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? Thereseems to me a very decided difference.  I can hardly keep my hands warmeven in my muff.  It was not so yesterday, I think.  The clouds seemparting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clearafternoon."Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning inthe appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approachingfrost.The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.Jennings's style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with herbehaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind.  Every thing in herhousehold arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, andexcepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton's regret, shehad never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction could atall discompose the feelings of her young companions.  Pleased to findherself more comfortably situated in that particular than she hadexpected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much realenjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home orabroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was withthem almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than fromany other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with muchconcern his continued regard for her sister.  She feared it was astrengthening regard.  It grieved her to see the earnestness with whichhe often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse thanwhen at Barton.About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby wasalso arrived.  His card was on the table when they came in from themorning's drive."Good God!" cried Marianne, "he has been here while we were out."Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured tosay, "Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow."  But Marianneseemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings's entrance, escaped withthe precious card.This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those ofher sister all, and more than all, their former agitation.  From thismoment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him everyhour of the day, made her unfit for any thing.  She insisted on beingleft behind, the next morning, when the others went out.Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Streetduring their absence; but a moment's glance at her sister when theyreturned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no secondvisit there.  A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table."For me!" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward."No, ma'am, for my mistress."But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up."It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!""You are expecting a letter, then?" said Elinor, unable to be longersilent."Yes, a little--not much."After a short pause.  "You have no confidence in me, Marianne.""Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have confidence in noone!""Me!" returned Elinor in some confusion; "indeed, Marianne, I havenothing to tell.""Nor I," answered Marianne with energy, "our situations then are alike.We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do notcommunicate, and I, because I conceal nothing."Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she wasnot at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, topress for greater openness in Marianne.Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read italoud.  It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in ConduitStreet the night before, and requesting the company of her mother andcousins the following evening.  Business on Sir John's part, and aviolent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drewnear, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, thatthey should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some difficultyin persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen nothing ofWilloughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad,than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is notmaterially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settledin town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twentyyoung people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was an affair,however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.  In the country, anunpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where thereputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, itwas risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have itknown that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or ninecouple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they hadnot seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to avoidthe appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and thereforenever came near her, they received no mark of recognition on theirentrance.  He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who theywere, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of theroom.  Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered: itwas enough--HE was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed toreceive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been assembled aboutan hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express hissurprise on seeing them in town, though Colonel Brandon had been firstinformed of their arrival at his house, and he had himself saidsomething very droll on hearing that they were to come."I thought you were both in Devonshire," said he."Did you?" replied Elinor."When do you go back again?""I do not know." And thus ended their discourse.Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she wasthat evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise.  Shecomplained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street."Aye, aye," said Mrs. Jennings, "we know the reason of all that verywell; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, youwould not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not verypretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.""Invited!" cried Marianne."So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met himsomewhere in the street this morning." Marianne said no more, butlooked exceedingly hurt.  Impatient in this situation to be doingsomething that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved towrite the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fearsfor the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had beenso long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure byperceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was againwriting to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any otherperson.About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself onbusiness, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, toorestless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from onewindow to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating allthat had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby's inconstancy, urging herby every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an accountof her real situation with respect to him.Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, andColonel Brandon was announced.  Marianne, who had seen him from thewindow, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before heentered it.  He looked more than usually grave, and though expressingsatisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat inparticular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word.Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which hersister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening.  It was not thefirst time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more thanonce before, beginning with the observation of "your sister looksunwell to-day," or "your sister seems out of spirits," he had appearedon the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, somethingparticular about her.  After a pause of several minutes, their silencewas broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he wasto congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was notprepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obligedto adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he meant?  Hetried to smile as he replied, "your sister's engagement to Mr.Willoughby is very generally known.""It cannot be generally known," returned Elinor, "for her own family donot know it."He looked surprised and said, "I beg your pardon, I am afraid myinquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecyintended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universallytalked of.""How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?""By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you aremost intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons.  Butstill I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhapsrather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something tosupport its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby inyour sister's writing.  I came to inquire, but I was convinced before Icould ask the question.  Is every thing finally settled?  Is itimpossible to-?  But I have no right, and I could have no chance ofsucceeding.  Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe I have been wrong insaying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence Ihave the strongest dependence.  Tell me that it is all absolutelyresolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, ifconcealment be possible, is all that remains."These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love forher sister, affected her very much.  She was not immediately able tosay anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated fora short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.  The realstate of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little knownto herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as liableto say too much as too little.  Yet as she was convinced thatMarianne's affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of ColonelBrandon's success, whatever the event of that affection might be, andat the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she thoughtit most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more thanshe really knew or believed.  She acknowledged, therefore, that thoughshe had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which theystood with each other, of their mutual affection she had no doubt, andof their correspondence she was not astonished to hear.He listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak,rose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,"to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that hemay endeavour to deserve her,"--took leave, and went away.Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, tolessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points; she was left, on thecontrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon'sunhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by heranxiety for the very event that must confirm it.Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinorregret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughbyneither came nor wrote.  They were engaged about the end of that timeto attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was keptaway by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this party,Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and seemingequally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared, without onelook of hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by thedrawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton'sarrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her attitude,lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister's presence; andwhen at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at thedoor, she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected.They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon asthe string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended thestairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to anotherin an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up, quite fullof company, and insufferably hot.  When they had paid their tribute ofpoliteness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permittedto mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat andinconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add.  After sometime spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down toCassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she andElinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no greatdistance from the table.They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceivedWilloughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnestconversation with a very fashionable looking young woman.  She sooncaught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting tospeak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;and then continued his discourse with the same lady.  Elinor turnedinvoluntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved byher.  At that moment she first perceived him, and her whole countenanceglowing with sudden delight, she would have moved towards himinstantly, had not her sister caught hold of her."Good heavens!" she exclaimed, "he is there--he is there--Oh! why doeshe not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?""Pray, pray be composed," cried Elinor, "and do not betray what youfeel to every body present.  Perhaps he has not observed you yet."This however was more than she could believe herself; and to becomposed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne, itwas beyond her wish.  She sat in an agony of impatience which affectedevery feature.At last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up,and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand tohim.  He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor thanMarianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to observeher attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, andasked how long they had been in town.  Elinor was robbed of allpresence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word.  Butthe feelings of her sister were instantly expressed.  Her face wascrimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?  Have you notreceived my letters?  Will you not shake hands with me?"He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and heheld her hand only for a moment.  During all this time he was evidentlystruggling for composure.  Elinor watched his countenance and saw itsexpression becoming more tranquil.  After a moment's pause, he spokewith calmness."I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to findyourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home.  My card was not lost, I hope.""But have you not received my notes?" cried Marianne in the wildestanxiety.  "Here is some mistake I am sure--some dreadful mistake.  Whatcan be the meaning of it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tellme, what is the matter?"He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassmentreturned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom hehad been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant exertion,he recovered himself again, and after saying, "Yes, I had the pleasureof receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were sogood as to send me," turned hastily away with a slight bow and joinedhis friend.Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk intoher chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, triedto screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her withlavender water."Go to him, Elinor," she cried, as soon as she could speak, "and forcehim to come to me.  Tell him I must see him again--must speak to himinstantly.-- I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment's peace till thisis explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.-- Oh go to himthis moment.""How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait.  This isnot the place for explanations.  Wait only till tomorrow."With difficulty however could she prevent her from following himherself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at least,with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him with moreprivacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continuedincessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings,by exclamations of wretchedness.  In a short time Elinor saw Willoughbyquit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Mariannethat he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again thatevening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.  She instantly beggedher sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she wastoo miserable to stay a minute longer.Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informedthat Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to herwish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, theydeparted as soon the carriage could be found.  Scarcely a word wasspoken during their return to Berkeley Street.  Marianne was in asilent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jenningswas luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room,where hartshorn restored her a little to herself.  She was soonundressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, hersister then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings,had leisure enough for thinking over the past.That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby andMarianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,seemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her ownwishes, SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake ormisapprehension of any kind.  Nothing but a thorough change ofsentiment could account for it.  Her indignation would have been stillstronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment whichseemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and preventedher from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting withthe affections of her sister from the first, without any design thatwould bear investigation.  Absence might have weakened his regard, andconvenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such aregard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must alreadyhave given her, and on those still more severe which might await her inits probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepestconcern.  Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while shecould ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided infuture, her mind might be always supported.  But every circumstancethat could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the miseryof Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate andirreconcilable rupture with him.Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day, or the sungained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne, onlyhalf dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sakeof all the little light she could command from it, and writing as fastas a continual flow of tears would permit her.  In this situation,Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first perceivedher; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety,said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness,"Marianne, may I ask-?""No, Elinor," she replied, "ask nothing; you will soon know all."The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted nolonger than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a returnof the same excessive affliction.  It was some minutes before she couldgo on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which stillobliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough ofher feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for thelast time to Willoughby.Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power; andshe would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had notMarianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervousirritability, not to speak to her for the world.  In suchcircumstances, it was better for both that they should not be longtogether; and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only preventedher from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed, butrequiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made herwander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of everybody.At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; andElinor's attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not inpitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring toengage Mrs. Jennings's notice entirely to herself.As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted aconsiderable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,round the common working table, when a letter was delivered toMarianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of adeath-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, who saw asplainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must comefrom Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made herhardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremour asmade her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings's notice.  That goodlady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter fromWilloughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which shetreated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it toher liking.  Of Elinor's distress, she was too busily employed inmeasuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; andcalmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,"Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in mylife!  MY girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolishenough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature.  Ihope, from the bottom of my heart, he won't keep her waiting muchlonger, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn.Pray, when are they to be married?"Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment,obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore,trying to smile, replied, "And have you really, Ma'am, talked yourselfinto a persuasion of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?  Ithought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems toimply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceiveyourself any longer.  I do assure you that nothing would surprise memore than to hear of their being going to be married.""For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so?  Don't weall know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears inlove with each other from the first moment they met?  Did not I seethem together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not Iknow that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy weddingclothes?  Come, come, this won't do.  Because you are so sly about ityourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no suchthing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever solong.  I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.""Indeed, Ma'am," said Elinor, very seriously, "you are mistaken.Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, andyou will find that you have though you will not believe me now."Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more,and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurriedaway to their room, where, on opening the door, she saw Mariannestretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,and two or three others laying by her.  Elinor drew near, but withoutsaying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her hand, kissedher affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst oftears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. Thelatter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness ofthis behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction, sheput all the letters into Elinor's hands; and then covering her facewith her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony.  Elinor, who knewthat such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have itscourse, watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spentitself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter, read asfollows:                              "Bond Street, January.     "MY DEAR MADAM,     "I have just had the honour of receiving your     letter, for which I beg to return my sincere     acknowledgments.  I am much concerned to find there     was anything in my behaviour last night that did     not meet your approbation; and though I am quite at     a loss to discover in what point I could be so     unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your     forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been     perfectly unintentional.  I shall never reflect on     my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire     without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter     myself it will not be broken by any mistake or     misapprehension of my actions.  My esteem for your     whole family is very sincere; but if I have been so     unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than     I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach myself     for not having been more guarded in my professions     of that esteem.  That I should ever have meant more     you will allow to be impossible, when you understand     that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere,     and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before     this engagement is fulfilled.  It is with great     regret that I obey your commands in returning the     letters with which I have been honoured from you,     and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed     on me.     "I am, dear Madam,               "Your most obedient                    "humble servant,                                        "JOHN WILLOUGHBY."With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by MissDashwood, may be imagined.  Though aware, before she began it, that itmust bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm theirseparation for ever, she was not aware that such language could besuffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capableof departing so far from the appearance of every honourable anddelicate feeling--so far from the common decorum of a gentleman, as tosend a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of bringingwith his desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged nobreach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--a letter ofwhich every line was an insult, and which proclaimed its writer to bedeep in hardened villainy.She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then readit again and again; but every perusal only served to increase herabhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against him,that she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might woundMarianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss toher of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and mostirremediable of all evils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipledman, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on thedepravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on thevery different mind of a very different person, who had no otherconnection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him withevery thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of hersister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and soentirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on hearinga carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see whocould be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment toperceive Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she knew had not been orderedtill one.  Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless ofcontributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuseherself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister beingindisposed.  Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern forits cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeingher safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to risefrom the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her fromfalling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper restand food; for it was many days since she had any appetite, and manynights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no longersupported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this wasfelt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervousfaintness.  A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,made her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express somesense of her kindness, by saying,"Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!""I only wish," replied her sister, "there were any thing I COULD do,which might be of comfort to you."This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne,who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, "Oh! Elinor, I ammiserable, indeed," before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief insilence."Exert yourself, dear Marianne," she cried, "if you would not killyourself and all who love you.  Think of your mother; think of hermisery while YOU suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself.""I cannot, I cannot," cried Marianne; "leave me, leave me, if Idistress you; leave me, hate me, forget me!  but do not torture me so.Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk ofexertion!  Happy, happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what Isuffer.""Do you call ME happy, Marianne?  Ah! if you knew!--And can you believeme to be so, while I see you so wretched!""Forgive me, forgive me," throwing her arms round her sister's neck; "Iknow you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet youare--you must be happy; Edward loves you--what, oh what, can do awaysuch happiness as that?""Many, many circumstances," said Elinor, solemnly."No, no, no," cried Marianne wildly, "he loves you, and only you.  YouCAN have no grief.""I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state.""And you will never see me otherwise.  Mine is a misery which nothingcan do away.""You must not talk so, Marianne.  Have you no comforts? no friends?  Isyour loss such as leaves no opening for consolation?  Much as yousuffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery ofhis character had been delayed to a later period--if your engagementhad been carried on for months and months, as it might have been,before he chose to put an end to it.  Every additional day of unhappyconfidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful.""Engagement!" cried Marianne, "there has been no engagement.""No engagement!""No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him.  He has broken no faithwith me.""But he told you that he loved you.""Yes--no--never absolutely.  It was every day implied, but neverprofessedly declared.  Sometimes I thought it had been--but it neverwas.""Yet you wrote to him?"--"Yes--could that be wrong after all that had passed?-- But I cannottalk."Elinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which nowraised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over thecontents of all.  The first, which was what her sister had sent him ontheir arrival in town, was to this effect.                         Berkeley Street, January.     "How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on     receiving this; and I think you will feel something     more than surprise, when you know that I am in town.     An opportunity of coming hither, though with Mrs.     Jennings, was a temptation we could not resist.     I wish you may receive this in time to come here     to-night, but I will not depend on it.  At any rate     I shall expect you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.                                             "M.D."Her second note, which had been written on the morning after the danceat the Middletons', was in these words:--     "I cannot express my disappointment in having     missed you the day before yesterday, nor my astonishment     at not having received any answer to a note which     I sent you above a week ago.  I have been expecting     to hear from you, and still more to see you, every     hour of the day.  Pray call again as soon as possible,     and explain the reason of my having expected this     in vain.  You had better come earlier another time,     because we are generally out by one.  We were last     night at Lady Middleton's, where there was a dance.     I have been told that you were asked to be of the     party.  But could it be so?  You must be very much     altered indeed since we parted, if that could be     the case, and you not there.  But I will not suppose     this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your     personal assurance of its being otherwise.                                            "M.D."The contents of her last note to him were these:--     "What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your     behaviour last night?  Again I demand an explanation     of it.  I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure     which our separation naturally produced, with the     familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared     to me to justify.  I was repulsed indeed! I have     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse     a conduct which can scarcely be called less than     insulting; but though I have not yet been able to     form any reasonable apology for your behaviour,     I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of     it.  You have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely     deceived, in something concerning me, which may have     lowered me in your opinion.  Tell me what it is,     explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall     be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you.  It     would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill     of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn that     you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that     your regard for us all was insincere, that your     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let     it be told as soon as possible.  My feelings are at     present in a state of dreadful indecision; I wish     to acquit you, but certainty on either side will be     ease to what I now suffer.  If your sentiments are     no longer what they were, you will return my notes,     and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.                                             "M.D."That such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have beenso answered, Elinor, for Willoughby's sake, would have been unwillingto believe.  But her condemnation of him did not blind her to theimpropriety of their having been written at all; and she was silentlygrieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofsof tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding, and most severelycondemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving that she had finishedthe letters, observed to her that they contained nothing but what anyone would have written in the same situation."I felt myself," she added, "to be as solemnly engaged to him, as ifthe strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other.""I can believe it," said Elinor; "but unfortunately he did not feel thesame.""He DID feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he felt it.  I knowhe did.  Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but theblackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dearto him as my own soul could wish.  This lock of hair, which now he canso readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnestsupplication.  Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard hisvoice at that moment!  Have you forgot the last evening of our beingtogether at Barton?  The morning that we parted too!  When he told methat it might be many weeks before we met again--his distress--can Iever forget his distress?"For a moment or two she could say no more; but when this emotion hadpassed away, she added, in a firmer tone,"Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.""Dearest Marianne, who but himself?  By whom can he have beeninstigated?""By all the world, rather than by his own heart.  I could ratherbelieve every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin mein his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty.  Thiswoman of whom he writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but yourown dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me.Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I would notrather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?"Elinor would not contend, and only replied, "Whoever may have been sodetestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your owninnocence and good intentions supports your spirits.  It is areasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence.""No, no," cried Marianne, "misery such as mine has no pride.  I carenot who knows that I am wretched.  The triumph of seeing me so may beopen to all the world.  Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may beproud and independent as they like--may resist insult, or returnmortification--but I cannot.  I must feel--I must be wretched--and theyare welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can.""But for my mother's sake and mine--""I would do more than for my own.  But to appear happy when I am somiserable--Oh! who can require it?"Again they were both silent.  Elinor was employed in walkingthoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,without knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerningobjects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,with her head leaning against one of its posts, again took upWilloughby's letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,exclaimed--"It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you.  Elinor, nothing can.  Whateverhe might have heard against me--ought he not to have suspended hisbelief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the powerof clearing myself? 'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable.Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?  Oh,barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?""No, Marianne, in no possible way.""And yet this woman--who knows what her art may have been?--how long itmay have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!--Who isshe?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young andattractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one, no one--hetalked to me only of myself."Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended thus."Elinor, I must go home.  I must go and comfort mama.  Can not we begone to-morrow?""To-morrow, Marianne!""Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby's sake--andnow who cares for me? Who regards me?""It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much morethan civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such ahasty removal as that.""Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long, Icannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people.The Middletons and Palmers--how am I to bear their pity?  The pity ofsuch a woman as Lady Middleton!  Oh, what would HE say to that!"Elinor advised her to lie down again, and for a moment she did so; butno attitude could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and bodyshe moved from one posture to another, till growing more and morehysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed atall, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call forassistance.  Some lavender drops, however, which she was at lengthpersuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jenningsreturned, she continued on the bed quiet and motionless.Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return, and withoutwaiting to have her request of admittance answered, opened the door andwalked in with a look of real concern."How do you do my dear?"--said she in a voice of great compassion toMarianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer."How is she, Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing! she looks very bad.-- Nowonder.  Ay, it is but too true.  He is to be married very soon--agood-for-nothing fellow!  I have no patience with him.  Mrs. Taylortold me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particularfriend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believedit; and I was almost ready to sink as it was.  Well, said I, all I cansay is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of myacquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife mayplague his heart out.  And so I shall always say, my dear, you maydepend on it.  I have no notion of men's going on in this way; and ifever I meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he has nothad this many a day.  But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne;he is not the only young man in the world worth having; and with yourpretty face you will never want admirers.  Well, poor thing!  I won'tdisturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry out at once andhave done with.  The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonightyou know, and that will amuse her."She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if shesupposed her young friend's affliction could be increased by noise.Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining withthem.  Elinor even advised her against it.  But "no, she would go down;she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less."Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive,though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner,said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her intothe dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmerthan her sister had expected.  Had she tried to speak, or had she beenconscious of half Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged attentionsto her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but not asyllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughtspreserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's kindness, though itseffusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, madeher those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities, which hersister could not make or return for herself.  Their good friend sawthat Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to herwhich might make her at all less so.  She treated her therefore, withall the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on thelast day of its holidays.  Marianne was to have the best place by thefire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and tobe amused by the relation of all the news of the day.  Had not Elinor,in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, shecould have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure adisappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and agood fire.  As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this wasforced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could stay no longer.With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her sister not tofollow her, she directly got up and hurried out of the room."Poor soul!" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, "how itgrieves me to see her!  And I declare if she is not gone away withoutfinishing her wine!  And the dried cherries too!  Lord! nothing seemsto do her any good.  I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, Iwould send all over the town for it.  Well, it is the oddest thing tome, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill!  But when there isplenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord blessyou! they care no more about such things!--""The lady then--Miss Grey I think you called her--is very rich?""Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.  Did you ever see her? a smart,stylish girl they say, but not handsome.  I remember her aunt verywell, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man.  But the familyare all rich together.  Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, itwon't come before it's wanted; for they say he is all to pieces.  Nowonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters!  Well, it don'tsignify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makeslove to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to flyoff from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl isready to have him.  Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, lethis house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? Iwarrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matterscame round.  But that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the way ofpleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age.""Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is?  Is she said to beamiable?""I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard hermentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one dayMiss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison wouldnot be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison couldnever agree."--"And who are the Ellisons?""Her guardians, my dear.  But now she is of age and may choose forherself; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now," after pausing amoment--"your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moanby herself.  Is there nothing one can get to comfort her?  Poor dear,it seems quite cruel to let her be alone.  Well, by-and-by we shallhave a few friends, and that will amuse her a little.  What shall weplay at?  She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she caresfor?""Dear ma'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.  Marianne, I dare say,will not leave her room again this evening.  I shall persuade her if Ican to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest.""Aye, I believe that will be best for her.  Let her name her ownsupper, and go to bed.  Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad andso cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has beenhanging over her head as long as that.  And so the letter that cametoday finished it!  Poor soul!  I am sure if I had had a notion of it,I would not have joked her about it for all my money.  But then you.
